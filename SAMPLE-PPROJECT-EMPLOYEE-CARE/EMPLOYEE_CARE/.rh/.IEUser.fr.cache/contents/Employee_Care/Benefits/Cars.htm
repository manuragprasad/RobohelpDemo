Whirl the World - Company Cars
Company cars are available to any UK employee who covers more than 10,000 miles on company business where it is anticipated this will continue year on year.
This is a taxable benefit even though the use is for business purposes. Where preferred, the employee can opt for a car allowance. It is a condition of accepting the car allowance that an appropriate vehicle is purchased to meet the business needs.
Details of the scheme are held by Human Resources and they will advise you of the monthly lease payment that will be sanctioned.
