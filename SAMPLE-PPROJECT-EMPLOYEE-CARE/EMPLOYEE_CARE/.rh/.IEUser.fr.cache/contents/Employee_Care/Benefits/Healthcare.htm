Whirl the World - Healthcare
Private healthcare plans are available to all employees. Each plan is salary related and for this purpose salary includes any commission that is part of the employee's contract.
Some schemes include family cover. Where this is not part of the scheme, employees can opt to fund such cover themselves at rates that are less than the scheme provider would offer generally.
Details of the schemes are held by Human Resources.
