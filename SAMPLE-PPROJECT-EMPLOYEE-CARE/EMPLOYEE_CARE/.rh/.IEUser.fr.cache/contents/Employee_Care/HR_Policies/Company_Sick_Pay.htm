Whirl the World - Company 
 Sick Pay
It is the Company’s policy that employees should neither suffer loss 
 of basic income nor increase their income during personal illness. Employees 
 who are unable to work because of personal illness will normally be granted 
 paid sick leave within time limits related to length of service.
Unless agreed otherwise, qualifying days will be the employee's normal 
 working days - Monday to Friday for the majority of employees.

		Company sick pay year
		The Company Sick Pay Year is from 1st 
		 January to 31st December. Where one continuous period of sickness

		 discontinuous, will count towards the maximum entitlement of paid 
		 sick leave in that year.

		 absences for long periods, the Company may call for confirmatory 
		 medical evidence and reserves the right to treat such cases as

		 of incapacity for work.
		SSP will be paid only for qualifying 
		 days, which are days on which the employee is normally required 
		 to work.

		 three qualifying days of any period of incapacity for work, which 
		 are called waiting days.
	
	
		Certification
		SSP requires that, if a period 
		 of sickness absence has lasted for seven days or less, a self-certification 
		 form must be provided by the employee.
		If the sickness absence is more than seven 
		 days, the employee's doctor must provide a standard NHS certificate. 
		  Further certificates must be received for each additional 
		 week of absence.

		SSP may be withheld from an employee 
		 who has failed to observe the notification procedure without good 
		 reason.

Procedure for eligibility - Company Sick Pay
Notification
Should you be too ill to come to work, you should telephone your manager 
 as soon as possible after the start of the working day and explain:
Why 
 you are unable to come to workHow 
 long you think the sickness absence might lastWhat 
 action you are taking to mitigate the effects of the illness - for example, 
 visiting the doctorWhere 
 you can be contacted during the day should the company need to get in 
 touch with you.



If you are not able to talk to your manager, then you should contact 
 the HR Department. If your incapacity lasts for more than one day, unless 
 you have submitted a doctor’s certificate, you should telephone every 
 other day to keep the organization abreast of progress, unless agreed 
 otherwise.
On your return to work
When you return to work, you should report to your line manager before 
 you begin work. Your manager will ask you about your illness and how well 
 you have recovered. Your manager will also ask you to complete a 
 self-certificate for the first seven days of illness.
Please note: the seven days includes those days on which you do not 
 normally work, such as weekends and public holidays.
If you have been absent for more than seven days (including weekends 
 and public holidays), you should bring with you a certificate from your 
 doctor. This should explain the nature of your illness and confirm that 
 you are fit to return to work.
If the organization has cause to be concerned about your health - for 
 example, you have had a number of periods of sickness for the same reason 
 in a short period - then your line manager may suggest that you visit 
 your doctor for a check-up. In certain circumstances, especially if your 
 long-term employment is in doubt because of your sickness record, then 
 the organization may ask you to see a medical practitioner of its choice.
Your sickness absence will be marked on your personnel record.
Abuse and unacceptable levels of absence
The Company may, at its discretion, discontinue sick pay for failure 
 to adhere to the above procedures or if there is doubt about the integrity 
 of a sick pay claim.
