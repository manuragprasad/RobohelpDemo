Whirl the World - Expenses
Expenses incurred while undertaking normal duties can be reclaimed at 
 the end of each calendar month. An advance payment can be made to assist 
 employees meeting significant expenses.
To minimise the amount that employees have to incur before receiving 
 reimbursement, company credit cards will be issued to employees who regularly 
 incur expenses exceeding US$400 
 per month.

User 
 defined variables have been used for the expense limits. This simplifies 
 updating when the rates change. By using Variable Sets, different amounts 
 can be simply entered for each country so that if exchange rates fluctuate, 
 the rate for just one country can be changed.
Limits
The limits below apply in most circumstances but can be exceeded where 
 prior sanction has been obtained from the authority shown.
