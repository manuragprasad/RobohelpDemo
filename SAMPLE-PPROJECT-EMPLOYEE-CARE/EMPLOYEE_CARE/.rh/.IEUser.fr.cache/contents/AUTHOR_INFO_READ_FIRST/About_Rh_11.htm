		Collaboration
		
	
	
		Cloud sharing for topics and resources
		 
		You can now 
		 add cloud-based services to Resource Manager.
		Adobe RoboHelp 11 ships with Dropbox, Google 
		 Drive, OneDrive pre-configured. You can either
		
			Include 
			 the root folder of these services in Resource Manager so that 
			 all your resources are available to you.
			Include 
			 just the sub-folder that you will be sharing. You specify 
			 which folder(s) will be shared using the settings on the service 
			 used.
		
		Your co-authors can do the same but they will 
		 only see the folders you have shared with them.
		You can right click individual topics or a 
		 bunch of topics in the Topic List or Project Manager and click 
		 Resource Manager > Share. It's that simple.
		RoboHelp will copy the topic to the cloud 
		 along with any dependent files such as images, style sheets and 
		 master pages. When the topic is taken into other projects, the 
		 dependent files will be downloaded as well. The shared topics 
		 can be moved to any folder in the other projects as can the dependent 
		 files, you don't have to keep the same relative path as in the 
		 original topic.
		The topic and the dependencies will remain 
		 synchronized or you can make certain changes:
		
			You can 
			 apply a different Master Page.
			You can 
			 have different Snippet content.
			You can 
			 apply a different CSS file.
			You can 
			 change the images.
			The placeholder 
			 for UDVs will be retained allowing a local UDV to be created 
			 with the values needed in each project.
		
		Master pages linked to a topic will automatically 
		 by shared or you can share them independently in the same way.
