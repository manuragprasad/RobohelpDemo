Mobile App Output
In RoboHelp 10 and 11 you could generate an Android app in debug mode. 
 That allowed authors to create an app that could be installed on an Android 
 device but it could not be uploaded to Google Play as it lacked the necessary 
 signature. Also it did not allow the creation of an iOS app for the same 
 reason. Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) introduces a new Single Source Layout 
 specifically for the creation of mobile apps for both Android and iOS 
 devices that can be installed from Google Play or the Apple Store.
Most of the settings are the same as for other outputs, it is the Application 
 Details fields that enable the app creation.

 

	
	
	
		Field
		Description
	
	
		Package
		This is effectively the filename. It is 
		 recommended you use only A-Z characters and the underscore. Use 
		 dots to separate the elements.
	
	
		Version
		Enter your version number.
	
	
		Version Code (Android)
		Enter the version of PhoneGap to be used.
	
	
		Title
		This is what will appear below the icon 
		 on the device.
	
	
		Description
		This will display on the PhoneGap apps 
		 page.
	
	
		Icon
		The icon that will display on the device 
		 to open the app.
	
	
		Splash Screen and Preview
		A splash screen that appears while the 
		 app opens.
	
	
		Phone Gap Credential
		Generation of the app is done online using 
		 the PhoneGap site. You need to register and select one of the 
		 options.
		The free PhoneGap plan allows you to create 
		 one app free. You can either register with PhoneGap direct and 
		 use that ID or you can use your Adobe ID. 
		Alternatively you can opt for a paid plan. 
		 See https://build.phonegap.com/ 
		 for more information. Essentially you can create 25 apps in a 
		 private repository or you can create more if you store the output 
		 as open source.
		Check first to see if one of your developers 
		 is already registered. If they are, you could use their credentials.
	
	
		Platform
		Tick either iOS or Android or both. The 
		 Signing Key Setup button will then be enabled. The details in 
		 that screen will need to be completed for apps that are to be 
		 available on Google Play or the Apple Store.
		Check first to see if one of your developers 
		 is already registered. If they are, you could use their credentials.
		If you are generating for Android, you can 
		 create an app in Debug mode and that does not require completion 
		 of the Signing Key Setup dialog. In Debug mode the app generated 
		 can be installed directly onto an Android phone but it cannot 
		 be uploaded to Google Play.
		The same option is not permitted on iOS devices, 
		 a Signing Key is required.
