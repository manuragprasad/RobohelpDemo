Responsive HTML5 Output
Responsive HTML5 outputs are easier to work with than Multiscreen HTML5 
 as there is only "one" output.

	With Multiscreen 
	 HTML5, you specify a different screen layout for each device. Some 
	 authors will prefer that approach as they can use different layouts 
	 with different content on different devices.
	With Responsive 
	 HTML5, one screen layout is used on all devices. What happens here 
	 is that if the user is viewing on a desktop, they will see one arrangement 
	 of the components of the screen, if they are viewing on say an iPhone 
	 or Android phone, they will see the components resized and rearranged 
	 in a layout to better suit that device. Your Adobe RoboHelp output 
	 takes care of all that. View on a desktop and resize the window to 
	 see it happening. Notice how the images get resized on the fly.

New in RoboHelp (2015 release)
The new layouts in this release greatly enhance the 
 end-user experience. In the new layouts you can:

	Configure the search results to appear in 
	 the content or topic panes
	Use the Comments field in the Status tab 
	 of Topic Properties for Descriptions that appear in the search instead 
	 of the first few lines of the topic.
	Show breadcrumbs and search context in the 
	 search results.
	Easily show/hide widgets such as index/glossary/TOC 
	 and so on.
	Add social widgets out of the box so that 
	 pages can be shared on Facebook or Twitter.
	Choose to hide the branding bar on smartphones 
	 to give more screen space.
	Convert to right to left layout with the 
	 click of a button. Note that you cannot create topics using right 
	 to left languages in RoboHelp. The content can be created by translation 
	 agencies or Technical Communication Suite users can link to FrameMaker 
	 content.

The new layout remembers the state of the books in 
 the TOC and two or more books can be expanded.
Setting Up
In the Output Setup tab, you will see a Screen Layouts option. Right 
 click that to open this dialog. Note the Check for new screen layouts 
 link. This dialog can also be accessed from the Responsive Layout dialog.


Having picked your preferred layout, expand it to see its parts. As 
 with Multiscreen HTML5, you can right click any of the resources it uses 
 but there is now a much easier way to edit selected items. Right click 
 the layout name itself and click Edit to open the simplified layout editor. 
 It provides the options that most authors will want.


That's it, your Responsive HTML5 layout is ready to be integrated into 
 your project.
Generating the Output
The General settings allow you to select the screen layout to be used 
 in this Responsive Single Source Layout.

	If you change 
	 your mind about what you set up earlier, you can select a different 
	 one from the dropdown.
	You can add 
	 to the list by clicking Add from Gallery.
	You can make 
	 final edits by clicking Customize.
	You can check 
	 the appearance by clicking Preview.
	Note the new 
	 Dynamic Content 
	 FIltering option in Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release).
	


Content
The Content settings are the same as with WebHelp. With Responsive HTML5, 
 the content will be the same on all devices. Use Multiscreen HTML5 if 
 you need to have different content on different devices.
If you are using Dynamic Content Filtering, the build expression should 
 only exclude content that you do not want to be included anywhere.

Search
The Search settings are also the same as with WebHelp.

Optimization
The Optimization settings are the same as with Multiscreen HTML5 and 
 need to be defined for the range of devices you will be supporting. For 
 most authors, the settings will be as shown below.

Publish
The Publish settings enable you to place your output directly onto a 
 server. Use these or just give your developer everything that is in your 
 Generate folder.

SharePoint
If you use SharePoint, the settings will need to be defined here. See 
 SharePoint Integration 
 for more information about SharePoint.
