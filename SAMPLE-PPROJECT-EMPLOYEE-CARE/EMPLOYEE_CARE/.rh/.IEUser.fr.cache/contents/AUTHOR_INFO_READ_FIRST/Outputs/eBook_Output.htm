 The eBook topics require a different Master Page without a link to the 
 Whirl the World website. This has been achieved by applying a different 
 Master Page in the Content options.

 
You will need an eBook reader such as Adobe 
 Digital Editions. The available devices vary in their support of different 
 features so thorough testing is required.
RoboHelp (2015 release) gives you the ability to embed any font 
 in the topics. Note that you must have a licence to distribute the font.
