The scenario
The creation of Employee Care 3 can be likened to updating the help 
 for a new release of software or a knowledge base, it takes what was there 
 before and updates the content.
The Employee Care project is the knowledge base of the fictional US 
 company, Whirl the World, a global travel company with subsidiaries in 
 Canada and the UK.

	In Employee 
	 Care 1 for RoboHelp 10, the project used Content Categories so that 
	 users in different countries could select from all the content or 
	 just from the topics relevant to their country.
	In Employee 
	 Care 2 for RoboHelp 11, Whirl the World decided to only provide online 
	 help for US users with special topics for users in other countries 
	 being produced in printed format.
	In Employee 
	 Care 3 for RoboHelp (2015 Version) , Whirl the Word have backtracked 
	 and decided that online content is required specific to a user's country. 
	 However, instead of providing this using Content Categories they want 
	 to create one output and allow users to apply the new Dynamic 
	 Content Filtering.

Many of the topics are substantially the same for employees in each 
 country. However, there are some differences because of the way the company 
 operates in each country and because of legislation. Sick Pay in the UK 
 is dealt with in a different way because of UK legislation so the Company 
 Sick Pay topic has different content for employees in the UK. Also UK 
 employees may be eligible for a company car under their employment contract 
 and that topic will only be available to UK users.
The tip image

 Tips and explanations will be indicated with the tip image shown 
 above.

	Most source 
	 topics will display cross hatching behind the text showing that a 
	 conditional build tag has been applied so that the tip does not appear 
	 in the output.
	Some of the 
	 tips need to be in the output. They will be "hidden" by 
	 using DHTML Dropdowns. Only the icon will show in the output to minimize 
	 distraction and you will need to click the icon to reveal the information. 
	 In the Design Editor, double click the icon to see the content.
