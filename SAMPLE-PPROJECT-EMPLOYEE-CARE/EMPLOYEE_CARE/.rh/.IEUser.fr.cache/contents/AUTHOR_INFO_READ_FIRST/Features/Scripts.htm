Scripts
Adobe RoboHelp has a powerful scripting capability and comes with a 
 number of prepared scripts. You can also find more on various websites 
 and many are free, you will find links on the Adobe RoboHelp forums. Scripts 
 can automate procedures that might otherwise take time to undertake manually. 
 Writing scripts is for advanced users and may require the assistance of 
 your developers.
Below are two examples of the scripts that ship with Adobe RoboHelp.

Glossary hotspot options
The Output Generator with Glossary 
 Styling script allows you to choose a Popup or Tooltip 
 instead of the traditional expanding hotspot for glossary terms.

Skinning a CHM file
CHMs are still a useful method of providing user assistance but Microsoft 
 have not updated the compiler for many years. As a result they now look 
 a bit dated. With the aid of a RoboHelp script they can look very similar 
 to WebHelp.
You just create WebHelp with the skin of your choice. Then you run the 
 WebHelp to CHM Converter script.
