The New User Interface
As soon as you open Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) you will see a major 
 change. Gone are the old toolbars to be replaced with a modern ribbon, 
 different themes, a quick access toolbar and a new Starter page.
The Ribbon
Whilst it may seem daunting at first, it was found to be quite intuitive 
 when creating this sample project.

The Quick Access Toolbar
Highlighted above is the customizable Quick Access Toolbar where you 
 can add your most frequently used items.
Themes
Shown above is the Light theme. If you prefer the trend towards darker 
 themes, you can change to the Dark theme. Just click Customize on the 
 Quick Access Toolbar and select More Commands.
