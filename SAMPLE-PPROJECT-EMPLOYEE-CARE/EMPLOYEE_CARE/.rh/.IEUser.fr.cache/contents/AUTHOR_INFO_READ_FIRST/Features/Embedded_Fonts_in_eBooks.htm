Embedded fonts in eBooks
Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) allows you to embed fonts in an eBook 
 to ensure your readers see exactly the font you want.
It is important to note that you must have a licence to distribute any 
 font you specify. Adobe RoboHelp will attempt to warn you if there is 
 a licensing issue but you must not rely on that, the responsibility is 
 yours.

Creating an eBook output is described in the eBook 
 Output topic.
