Snippets
Content Reuse for Images, Tables, Text and More
Snippets are blocks that can contain text, variables, images and suchlike 
 to form a complete paragraph. They are especially useful where you need 
 to repeat the same content in many topics as any change only has to be 
 made once.
Snippet Management
The Snippets pod supports creating categories and organizing many different 
 Snippets into different categories. This will help simplify the management 
 of Snippets.
Some Adobe RoboHelp authors have developed quite a number of Snippets. 
 For an Adobe RoboHelp author that has created a large number of snippets, 
 they will find a field at the top of the Snippets pod that allows them 
 to search for Snippets.

Snippet Conversion
Occasionally the Adobe RoboHelp author has a need to convert a snippet 
 appearing inside a topic to become part of the actual topic content. This 
 may be where the snippet has to be different in one topic.
Adobe RoboHelp allows the help author to right-click a snippet inside 
 a topic and convert the content from a Snippet to topic content.
