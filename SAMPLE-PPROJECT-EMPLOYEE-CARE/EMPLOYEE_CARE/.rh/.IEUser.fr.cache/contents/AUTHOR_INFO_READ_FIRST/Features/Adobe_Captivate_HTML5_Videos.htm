Adobe Captivate HTML5 Videos
More and more authors are asked to include Adobe Captivate Animated 
 Video tutorials into their Adobe Robohelp projects. RoboHelp then becomes 
 a "launching pad" for eLearning.
You can see an example in the Sales 
 Staff Video topic.
The Process of Importing:
First the Adobe Captivate project is published as both Flash (SWF) and 
 HTML5 Output.
Then the author clicks the Captivate icon on the Insert ribbon to insert 
 it right into the topic where they want it to display.
Insert the paths of the Adobe Captivate HTML5 output files
The next step is to locate the paths to the SWF and the Index.html from 
 the Captivate output as shown here. Then click, OK.
Optimize Settings for HTML5 viewing of video
The video can now play in most any of the Single Source Layouts including, 
 Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF formats!
You need to test the output against the browsers that you support and 
 optimize the settings.
