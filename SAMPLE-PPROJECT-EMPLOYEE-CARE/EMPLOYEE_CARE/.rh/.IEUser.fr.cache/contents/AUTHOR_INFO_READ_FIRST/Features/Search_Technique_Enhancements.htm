Enhanced Search Results in Responsive Layouts
The author can now choose whether to open the search results in the 
 main Topic pane, or the Navigation Sidebar.

 
This is accomplished by selecting "true" in the Responsive 
 Layout Customization Editor shown here.

Author-Customized Search Context
The Search Context (the text under the Topic Title) can be customized 
 by the author. The default is a short amount of the first paragraph to 
 give the reader a sense of what the topic is about.

Improving Search Ranking
One way to help your users find the most relevant results is with the 
 Search Ranking capabilities Adobe RoboHelp. For WebHelp or WebHelp Pro, 
 the author can control whether or not the Search Ranking column in the 
 Search Results is presented.
To disable Search Ranking, examine the properties of the WebHelp or 
 WebHelp Pro single source layouts and ensure the option labeled Hide Rank 
 Column in Search Results is enabled.
Search Ranking is influenced by a number of factors including this hierarchy:
Search Keyword(s) appear in this order of importance:


	Title 
	 of a topic
	Topic 
	 Keyword - this is very powerful. (See Keywords on the General 
	 tab of Topic Properties)
	Headings 
	 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (in that order)
	Number 
	 of times in topic text
	Project 
	 Synonyms created from Output Tab > Synonyms.

Support for AND search
By default, RoboHelp performs OR searches when a user types multiple 
 words without enclosing them in quotation marks. This means that RoboHelp 
 finds all topics that have any of the words specified in the Search box. 
 The end user may want to limit the search where specific words occur in 
 the same topic. This can now be done with the new AND Search feature.
AND Examples:
Image AND photo finds topics containing 
 both terms.
Image AND photo AND graphic finds 
 records containing all three terms.
Enabling this feature for WebHelp and WebHelp Pro:
In the output settings, you can specify 
 whether or not AND search should be enabled by default. In addition, when 
 AND search is supported in the output, end users have the option to enable 
 or disable it. For WebHelp and WebHelp Pro, select the Show AND Search 
 In Output option in the output settings, RoboHelp performs AND search 
 when a user types multiple words without enclosing them in quotation marks. 
 Then, RoboHelp finds only the topics that have all the words specified 
 in the Search box.  AND search can be used in combination with phrase 
 search.
To enable AND Search in Multiscreen HTML5 Screen Layouts place a Multiscreen 
 HTML5 Widget - "Advanced Search Options" into your screen layout.
External Content Search metadata provides access to user-generated 
 content
The help author may now be a "curator" of content that guides 
 the end-user more precisely to the most relevant material. Today, help 
 systems go beyond static help files. There are blogs, wikis, and other 
 Web 2.0 communities that are happy to share information whether it relates 
 to work or play. Your end-users may tap into this rich and dynamic repository 
 to find information as well as contribute to the body of information themselves.
This is accomplished by using External Content Search. This makes it 
 easy to enter the search metadata. The author may create keywords that 
 are linked to a URL. When the end user uses RoboHelp's search facility 
 and searches for these keywords, the links are listed among the search 
 results and ranked in the top position. The resulting link presents a 
 live site inside the topic pane.

Notice the Conditional Build Tag "Draft" has been added to 
 the Travelocity search term.
What the External Content Search feature does
Example Scenario: An author wants to make it convenient for users to 
 make travel arrangements. The company wants certain travel sites to come 
 up in the search results for certain keywords that users may enter, such 
 as

	
	
	
		
			Sales
			Funnel
			Expedia
			Xpedia
			xpeedia
		
		
			
				Travel
				Travelocity
				Orbitz
				Orbits
			
		
		 
	

You can create a Google Advanced Search of a specific term (or terms) 
 then capture the URL from the address bar of the browser and use this 
 URL in order to allow pre-populating of a Google search. If you open the 
 External Content Search pod you can see this in action and note how the 
 terms are associated with the link. The External Content Search keywords 
 cause the associated Link to rank at the number one position.
How to see the External Content Search feature in action

 Search dialog.Click

Searching documents in their file native formats
Sometimes, a file must remain in its native format. So files such as 
 PDFs, Docs, Spreadsheets and PowerPoints 
 can be added to your project and be searchable. RoboHelp calls these "Baggage" 
 files because they "go along for the ride" when you publish 
 your project. Now you have your choice to include or exclude those baggage 
 file types. This includes support for CJK (Chinese 
 / Japanese / Korean) search as well.
