Whether you are new to Adobe RoboHelp or one of the thousands of longtime 
 users, it's always helpful to have an example to see how things work in 
 a real project. Some are described in the general information about Adobe 
 RoboHelp and in the topics that describe this sample project. Below you 
 will find links to some of those topics as well as links to other features 
 that are part of RoboHelp but that are not specifically featured in this 
 sample project.
Although you will see or read about the feature, it is beyond the scope 
 of this project to offer a detailed step-by-step tutorial for implementing 
 the feature. The screenshots will not necessarily be from this project.
