The Employee Care 3 
 Outputs
In Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) the term "Outputs" is used 
 instead of "Layouts" to distinguish them from the layouts used 
 in Responsive HTML5 and Multiscreen outputs.
The topics below provide information about each of the outputs that 
 you will find in the Outputs pod. Press 
 CTRL + Click to open them here in the Design Editor pod.
