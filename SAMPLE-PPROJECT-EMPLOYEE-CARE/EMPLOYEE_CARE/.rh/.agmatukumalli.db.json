When the topic is taken into other projects, the \n\t\t dependent files will be downloaded as well. The shared topics \n\t\t can be moved to any folder in the other projects as can the dependent \n\t\t files, you don't have to keep the same relative path as in the \n\t\t original topic.\n\t\tThe topic and the dependencies will remain \n\t\t synchronized or you can make certain changes:\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYou can \n\t\t\t apply a different Master Page.\n\t\t\tYou can \n\t\t\t have different Snippet content.\n\t\t\tYou can \n\t\t\t apply a different CSS file.\n\t\t\tYou can \n\t\t\t change the images.\n\t\t\tThe placeholder \n\t\t\t for UDVs will be retained allowing a local UDV to be created \n\t\t\t with the values needed in each project.\n\t\t\n\t\tMaster pages linked to a topic will automatically \n\t\t by shared or you can share them independently in the same way.\n\t\tRead \n\t\t more...\n\t\n\t\n\t\tToolbar changes\n\t\tThere are new toolbar icons to make synchronizing \n\t\t shared resources easier.

Here are some of those.\nExpanding and Dropdown Hotspots with Dynamic HTML (DHTML)\nThe idea of \"progressive disclosure\" is something authors \n are using in order to layer content especially with smaller screens on \n mobile devices. In this way, the end-user self-selects the information \n they are interested in. You can access DHTML on the Insert ribbon.\nTopic Titles can have User Defined Variables assigned\nControl and customize content better by applying a User Defined Variable \n to a wider range of content, including the Topic Title and Table of Contents. \n Automate updates by simply making a single change to the UDV value in \n the UDV pod. To see this in action, go to the About \n Employee Care 3 topic, right click on the topic and choose \"Topic \n Properties.\" You will see that the Knowledge Base Name User Defined \n Variable has been inserted in to the Topic Title.\n\n \nThe UDV Properties tell you where the each UDV has been used...\n\n \n... and that can include the Table of Contents.\n \nControl + Click jumps you to your target topic in Design Editor\nTry control + click on this link to \n jump to the About Employee Care 3 topic.\nClear Formatting and Reset Style\nOne constant frustration for authors is importing content from documents \n written without proper styling. When imported into RoboHelp, \"inline styles\" or \"overides\" \n can defeat your hard work in designing a proper CSS. Clear Formatting \n and Reset Style are commands that let your CSS control the styling without \n inline styles getting in the way.\n\n\tMake a selection \n\t and click Format > Clear formatting. All styling is cleared.\n\tReset Style \n\t is done from the Styles and Formatting pod. In this scenario, resetting \n\t a style resets both CSS and inline styles from a single HTML element \n\t by removing style related attributes like \"class\" and \"style\" \n\t from selected HTML element tag. Other CSS code remains.\n\nEnhanced CSS3 management\nCreate CSS styles either using a built-in visual style editor or choose \n a new HTML code editor for those who like to edit directly. View and modify \n attributes, edit the <img> tags, and format \n hyperlinks, text boxes, and block elements.\nClose All But This\nWhen the help author has elected to use the Allow Editing of Multiple \n Topics function, they are also able to right-click any tab in the editor \n and choose to close all other open tabs.\nRemember Project State\nFrom RoboHelp (2015 release) whichever topics you have open in the Design \n Editor when you close it will reopen when you return.\nNote: Which topics were open is held in the CPD \n file so if you delete the CPD, RoboHelp will not reopen the topics.\n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"Dynamic_Content_Filtering.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Dynamic_Content_Filtering.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/Content Filtering.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/Content Filtering.hts"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/Content Filtering.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/Content Filtering.hts"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::Title":"Content Categories","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Content_Categories.htm::InnerText":"\nContent Categories\nDynamic Content Filtering \n is an HTML5 feature for responsive layouts as it relies on code not available \n in WebHelp.

The HTML5 code for the desktop view \n\t\t was made cleaner in RoboHelp 11 to enable the pages to load faster \n\t\t with a 50% reduction in loading time and take less space with \n\t\t savings of ~20KB per topic. This improvement has now been extended \n\t\t to work with all devices.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCreate apps for iOS, Android \n\t\t and Windows platforms\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMobile app output support\n\t\tMobile app generation is greatly simplified \n\t\t in RoboHelp (2015 release) . You can generate mobile apps for \n\t\t your content for iOS and Android platforms in a seamless one click \n\t\t generation process. The workflow uses an integration with PhoneGap.\n\t\tIf you need to generate multiple apps, you \n\t\t will need to purchase a Phonegap license separately.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tA new ribbon based user \n\t\t interface and productivity enhancements\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRibbon based UI\n\t\tNow work in a modern Ribbon Based interface \n\t\t where all menu items are logically grouped in various tabs according \n\t\t to common workflows allowing easy accessibility and more productivity. \n\t\t Some tabs are context sensitive; the Table tab for example only \n\t\t appears when you are editing a table.\n\t\tCustomize the interface by choosing one of \n\t\t four themes and select either colored or greyscale icons. Boost \n\t\t your productivity with the customizable quick access toolbar, \n\t\t contextual tabs, and much more.\n\t\tIf your screen size is limited in depth you \n\t\t can set the ribbon to auto-hide when not needed.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEnhanced find and replace\n\t\tNow work much faster with the revamped \n\t\t Find & Replace \n\t\t functionality. You now use the same pod whether you want to look \n\t\t in a single topic or search through all your topics. You can search \n\t\t in backward or forward direction and set the search scope to \"current \n\t\t project\", \"current window\", \"specific folder\", \n\t\t or all opened files.\n\t\tMulti line search is also supported and you \n\t\t can search in the TOC and Index pods. You can zip through search \n\t\t results to easily edit the topic by double clicking any line.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNamed condition build expressions\n\t\tIf you work with complex build expressions \n\t\t you will know how difficult it can be to remember the purpose \n\t\t of each one. Now you can name the expressions making choosing \n\t\t the right one so much simpler. It eliminates the hassle of remembering \n\t\t and deciphering the logic every time you want to use an expression.\n\t\tYou can see this in the Dynamic \n\t\t Content Filtering topic.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEnhanced conditional tag indicators\n\t\tWith enhanced conditional tags indicators \n\t\t in Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) , the readability of the content \n\t\t is not compromised even if multiple tags are applied on any given \n\t\t content. Furthermore, it is easy to figure out which tags are \n\t\t applied and where conditions change within a topic. Cross hatching \n\t\t broke legibility, overlining means you can still read the content.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRemember project state\n\t\tIn Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) you no \n\t\t longer need to remember which topics and pods were opened the \n\t\t last time when you closed a project as the project state is automatically \n\t\t remembered Each time you a open a project, it opens in exactly \n\t\t the state in which it was closed.\n\t\tNote: Which topics were open is held in \n\t\t the CPD file so if you delete the CPD, RoboHelp will not reopen \n\t\t the topics.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAdobe Captivate support\n\t\tEasily integrate HTML5 and SWF content \n\t\t created with Adobe Captivate. Enhance your help content with show-me \n\t\t demos, how-to movies, and interactive quizzes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLocate in Project Manager\n\t\tNeed to locate a specific topic in the \n\t\t Project Manager? No problem, with just a single click on the topic, \n\t\t or in the TOC and topic list pod, you can locate and highlight \n\t\t the topic in the Project Manager.\n\t\tClick Locate Item in the View group on the \n\t\t Project tab or right click in a topic and select from the context \n\t\t menu.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEasily update styles\n\t\tYou can easily edit the style in a CSS \n\t\t by first applying inline styling and then click Update Style so \n\t\t that the CSS is updated.\n\t\n\n \nSee About RoboHelp 11 if you want to know \n what was added in that version.\n \n \n \n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"About_RoboHelp_2015.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/About_RoboHelp_2015.htm"},{"origLink":"About_Rh_11.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/About_Rh_11.htm"},{"origLink":"The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm"},{"origLink":"Features/Explore_Feature_and_Workflow_Topics_.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Explore_Feature_and_Workflow_Topics_.htm"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"Features/Dynamic_Content_Filtering.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Dynamic_Content_Filtering.htm"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Variables":["KB_Name","KB_Name"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Author":"Ann Author","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Title":"About {KB_Name}","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm::InnerText":"\nAbout Employee Care 3\n Reading this topic is key \n to understanding how to use this sample project.\nThis sample project updates the version that shipped with Adobe RoboHelp \n 11 and is designed to show some of the new features in Adobe RoboHelp \n (2015 release).\n\n\tAbout \n\t RoboHelp (2015 release) describes what is new in RoboHelp \n\t (2015 release).\n\tAbout \n\t RoboHelp 11 is for those upgrading from earlier versions.\n\tThe topics in \n\t the Author Info folders include information to help you understand \n\t the project.\n\tThe \n\t Employee Care SSLs (Single Source Layouts) topic explains the \n\t pre-configured outputs, how they have been set up and how to create \n\t the different types of help.\n\tThere is a section \n\t describing various features of RoboHelp, old and new. See Explore \n\t Feature and Workflow Topics.\n\tIf you prefer to read a printed \n\t version of all the topics in the Author_Info folder, a Printed Documentation \n\t layout has been set up for the purpose. Just generate the document \n\t from there.\n\t\n\n Press Ctrl and click to \n open the links above topics in this Design Editor pod.\nThe scenario\nThe creation of Employee Care 3 can be likened to updating the help \n for a new release of software or a knowledge base, it takes what was there \n before and updates the content.\nThe Employee Care project is the knowledge base of the fictional US \n company, Whirl the World, a global travel company with subsidiaries in \n Canada and the UK.\n\n\tIn Employee \n\t Care 1 for RoboHelp 10, the project used Content Categories so that \n\t users in different countries could select from all the content or \n\t just from the topics relevant to their country.\n\tIn Employee \n\t Care 2 for RoboHelp 11, Whirl the World decided to only provide online \n\t help for US users with special topics for users in other countries \n\t being produced in printed format.\n\tIn Employee \n\t Care 3 for RoboHelp (2015 Version) , Whirl the Word have backtracked \n\t and decided that online content is required specific to a user's country. \n\t However, instead of providing this using Content Categories they want \n\t to create one output and allow users to apply the new Dynamic \n\t Content Filtering.\n\nMany of the topics are substantially the same for employees in each \n country. However, there are some differences because of the way the company \n operates in each country and because of legislation. Sick Pay in the UK \n is dealt with in a different way because of UK legislation so the Company \n Sick Pay topic has different content for employees in the UK. Also UK \n employees may be eligible for a company car under their employment contract \n and that topic will only be available to UK users.\nThe tip image\n\n Tips and explanations will be indicated with the tip image shown \n above.\n\n\tMost source \n\t topics will display cross hatching behind the text showing that a \n\t conditional build tag has been applied so that the tip does not appear \n\t in the output.\n\tSome of the \n\t tips need to be in the output. They will be \"hidden\" by \n\t using DHTML Dropdowns. Only the icon will show in the output to minimize \n\t distraction and you will need to click the icon to reveal the information. \n\t In the Design Editor, double click the icon to see the content.\n\n \n \n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm"},{"origLink":"Outputs/Mobile_App_Output.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Mobile_App_Output.htm"},{"origLink":"Outputs/Multiscreen_HTML5_Output.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Multiscreen_HTML5_Output.htm"},{"origLink":"Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm"},{"origLink":"Outputs/eBook_Output.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/eBook_Output.htm"},{"origLink":"Outputs/Microsoft_HTML_Output_CHM.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Microsoft_HTML_Output_CHM.htm"},{"origLink":"Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm"},{"origLink":"Outputs/XML_Output.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/XML_Output.htm"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Variables":["KB_Name","KB_Name"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Conditions":["Others:Online_Only"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Author":"Ann Author","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Title":"The {KB_Name} Outputs","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/The_Employee_Care_Outputs.htm::InnerText":"\nThe Employee Care 3 \n Outputs\nIn Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) the term \"Outputs\" is used \n instead of \"Layouts\" to distinguish them from the layouts used \n in Responsive HTML5 and Multiscreen outputs.\nThe topics below provide information about each of the outputs that \n you will find in the Outputs pod.

The appearance \n adapts to suit the device, RoboHelp takes care of that. Now Adobe RoboHelp \n (2015 release) adds new layouts with something extra for your end-users, \n dynamic content filtering.\n\n\tYou provide the filter options to suit the \n\t requirement, be that geographical regions, trade specialization, equipment \n\t type and so on.\n\tThe end-user chooses what they want to see \n\t rather than having to wade through everything you have provided.\n\nYou can set this up so that the user can select just one of the options \n or so that they can multi-pick.\nIf you have used Content Categories (Dynamic User-Centric Content) in \n an earlier version of RoboHelp you will welcome the greater options Dynamic \n Content Filtering brings, so will your end-users. There are some differences \n in the setup and these are described below.\nHow does it work?\nTo set up the content to work with Dynamic Content Filtering, you need \n to be familiar with the use of conditional build tags (CBTs) and build \n expressions. A CBT is applied to some text or an image or any part of \n the topic content so that you can create simple or complex build expressions \n to exclude or include that content when you generate an output.\nDynamic Content Filtering allows you to use the CBTs and / or build \n expressions so that the end-user can choose what they want to see.\nExample\nObjective\nIn Employee Care we want end-users to see content according to where \n they are based. This is shown in this table.\n\n \nSetup - Global exclusions\nThe first thing we need to do is exclude from the output any content \n that we do not want the end-users to see, no matter how they apply the \n filters that we make available. That is done in the Content configuration \n where you can see that we do not want any topics or content that has an \n eBookOnly, Print or AuthorContent tag applied.\nThe Conditional Build Expression below excludes them from the output \n so we do not need to worry about them when we apply the filtering options.\n\n \nSetup - Filtering options\nWith the required content in the output, we now need to set up how it \n can be filtered. To do this the Use Dynamic Content Filter check-box is \n selected and the Customize button is then clicked.\n\n \nClicking Customize displays this dialog.\n\n \nIcon 1 allows us to set up groups, in this example we only want one, \n Country.\nIcon 2 displays the Tags and Expressions dialog that allows us to set \n up the options within that group.\nIn this project we want to set up US, Canada and UK as the filtering \n options. As shown below, the dialog initially shows all the tags and expressions \n that have been set up in the project. In RoboHelp (2015 release) expressions \n can be named making it much easier to deal with those complex expressions \n where you had to stop and work out what each one did.\nThe expression shown below is to keep certain content from this output \n and that was selected in the Content Settings dialog above. Here we want \n to create the filter options so we select Canada, UK and US.\n\n \nThe title can be whatever you want so here we have used it to provide \n an instruction to end-users.\nAs we only want end-users to select one country at a time, we leave \n the Allow Multiple Selection option unticked.\nThe end result in the Dynamic Content Filter dialog will be as in the \n image below. By default RoboHelp will display the options selected in \n alphabetical order, here we have used the arrow keys to change the order \n and we have used a context menu to make US the default.\n\n \nOutput\nWhen the end-user accesses the output they can click the filter icon \n and select from the options you have provided. In a different project \n you might want to provide further groups such as Region and so on.\n\nComplex Filtering\nIf you want to see a more sophisticated example of Dynamic Content Filtering, \n see the Travel the Whirls sample project.\nChanging from Content Categories to Dynamic Content Filtering\nIf you have previously used Content Categories in WebHelp and now want \n to use Dynamic Content Filtering with a responsive layout in the same \n project, there are some considerations.\n\n\tIf you used a single TOC or Index with tags \n\t applied, you will be able to use that with Dynamic Content Filtering. \n\t If you used a different TOC or Index for each category, you will need \n\t to change to using a single TOC or Index with CBTs applied, as in \n\t this sample project.\n\tYou can only use one glossary and it is \n\t not possible to apply CBTs to it.\n\tIf you used variables only to allow quick \n\t name changes so that each variable only had one value, that will work \n\t with Dynamic Content Filtering. If you used variables so that each \n\t instance could have a different value in different outputs, then you \n\t will need to make some changes. \n\tIn this project there are outputs that require selection of a particular \n\t variable set - for example in the Printed Outputs the US, Canada and \n\t UK sets are required. For that reason a new Dynamic Content Filtering \n\t set has been created for this project. To deal with the variables \n\t where different values are required according the filtering option, \n\t you will see that each value has been entered with a conditional build \n\t tag applied.\n\nRoboHelp 11 Responsive Layouts\nThe responsive layouts that shipped with RoboHelp 11 will not support \n Dynamic Content Filtering. You will need to change to one of the RoboHelp \n (2015 release) layouts.\n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/CHMSkinScript_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/CHMSkinScript_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/glossary_restyler_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/glossary_restyler_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/chm.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/chm.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/chm_skinned.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/chm_skinned.png"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::Title":"Scripts","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Scripts.htm::InnerText":"\nScripts\nAdobe RoboHelp has a powerful scripting capability and comes with a \n number of prepared scripts.

The default is a short amount of the first paragraph to \n give the reader a sense of what the topic is about.\n\nImproving Search Ranking\nOne way to help your users find the most relevant results is with the \n Search Ranking capabilities Adobe RoboHelp. For WebHelp or WebHelp Pro, \n the author can control whether or not the Search Ranking column in the \n Search Results is presented.\nTo disable Search Ranking, examine the properties of the WebHelp or \n WebHelp Pro single source layouts and ensure the option labeled Hide Rank \n Column in Search Results is enabled.\nSearch Ranking is influenced by a number of factors including this hierarchy:\nSearch Keyword(s) appear in this order of importance:\n\n\n\tTitle \n\t of a topic\n\tTopic \n\t Keyword - this is very powerful. (See Keywords on the General \n\t tab of Topic Properties)\n\tHeadings \n\t 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (in that order)\n\tNumber \n\t of times in topic text\n\tProject \n\t Synonyms created from Output Tab > Synonyms.\n\nSupport for AND search\nBy default, RoboHelp performs OR searches when a user types multiple \n words without enclosing them in quotation marks. This means that RoboHelp \n finds all topics that have any of the words specified in the Search box. \n The end user may want to limit the search where specific words occur in \n the same topic. This can now be done with the new AND Search feature.\nAND Examples:\nImage AND photo finds topics containing \n both terms.\nImage AND photo AND graphic finds \n records containing all three terms.\nEnabling this feature for WebHelp and WebHelp Pro:\nIn the output settings, you can specify \n whether or not AND search should be enabled by default. In addition, when \n AND search is supported in the output, end users have the option to enable \n or disable it. For WebHelp and WebHelp Pro, select the Show AND Search \n In Output option in the output settings, RoboHelp performs AND search \n when a user types multiple words without enclosing them in quotation marks. \n Then, RoboHelp finds only the topics that have all the words specified \n in the Search box.  AND search can be used in combination with phrase \n search.\nTo enable AND Search in Multiscreen HTML5 Screen Layouts place a Multiscreen \n HTML5 Widget - \"Advanced Search Options\" into your screen layout.\nExternal Content Search metadata provides access to user-generated \n content\nThe help author may now be a \"curator\" of content that guides \n the end-user more precisely to the most relevant material. Today, help \n systems go beyond static help files. There are blogs, wikis, and other \n Web 2.0 communities that are happy to share information whether it relates \n to work or play. Your end-users may tap into this rich and dynamic repository \n to find information as well as contribute to the body of information themselves.\nThis is accomplished by using External Content Search. This makes it \n easy to enter the search metadata. The author may create keywords that \n are linked to a URL. When the end user uses RoboHelp's search facility \n and searches for these keywords, the links are listed among the search \n results and ranked in the top position. The resulting link presents a \n live site inside the topic pane.\n\nNotice the Conditional Build Tag \"Draft\" has been added to \n the Travelocity search term.\nWhat the External Content Search feature does\nExample Scenario: An author wants to make it convenient for users to \n make travel arrangements. The company wants certain travel sites to come \n up in the search results for certain keywords that users may enter, such \n as\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSales\n\t\t\tFunnel\n\t\t\tExpedia\n\t\t\tXpedia\n\t\t\txpeedia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTravel\n\t\t\t\tTravelocity\n\t\t\t\tOrbitz\n\t\t\t\tOrbits\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\nYou can create a Google Advanced Search of a specific term (or terms) \n then capture the URL from the address bar of the browser and use this \n URL in order to allow pre-populating of a Google search. If you open the \n External Content Search pod you can see this in action and note how the \n terms are associated with the link. The External Content Search keywords \n cause the associated Link to rank at the number one position.\nHow to see the External Content Search feature in action\nGenerate \n one of the supported outputs with the External Content Search feature \n enabled.The supported \n outputs for this feature are:\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMultiscreen \n\t\t HTML5\n\t\tResponsive \n\t\t HTML5\n\t\tWebHelp\n\t\tWebHelp \n\t\t Pro\n\t\tFlashHelp\n\t\tFlashHelp \n\t\t Pro\n\t\n\nView the \n output.Perform \n a search using one of the search terms programmed in the External Content \n Search dialog.Click \n one of the resulting search result links.\n\n\n\nSearching documents in their file native formats\nSometimes, a file must remain in its native format. So files such as \n PDFs, Docs, Spreadsheets and PowerPoints \n can be added to your project and be searchable. RoboHelp calls these \"Baggage\" \n files because they \"go along for the ride\" when you publish \n your project. Now you have your choice to include or exclude those baggage \n file types. This includes support for CJK (Chinese \n / Japanese / Korean) search as well.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/RH-VersionControl-Toolbar.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/RH-VersionControl-Toolbar.png"},{"origLink":"Sharing_Topics_and_Other_Resources.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Sharing_Topics_and_Other_Resources.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/Sharepoint-DesktopSettingsPublishLocation.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/Sharepoint-DesktopSettingsPublishLocation.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/Sharepoint-DesktopSettings.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/Sharepoint-DesktopSettings.png"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::Title":"SharePoint Integration","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm::InnerText":"\nSharePoint Integration\nYour RoboHelp project can be integrated with Sharepoint to provide source control and you can publish your outputs to SharePoint.

HTML5 Output\nIf you have not previously created any HTML5 outputs, \n you may find it easier to start with the new Responsive HTML5 output introduced \n in Adobe RoboHelp 11.\nMultiscreen HTML5 allows you to create different designs and publish \n different content for different devices from the same source material. \n The configuration for each device can be optimized to suit the operating \n system, be it Windows, Android or iOS.\nThe steps are quite straightforward.\nIn the \n Output Setup you use the supplied profiles and screen layouts or you can \n set up your own. Screen Profiles set out parameters to identify a device \n by screen size and / or the browser used. For example you can set up one \n profile for Android devices, one for iPhones, one for iPads and a catch \n all for browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. You can \n also set screen size parameters for each of the browsers so provide more \n than one layout per browser.In the \n Multiscreen HTML 5 layout you map those profiles to the layouts you have \n chosen. By that means the smaller screen devices can use one layout while \n the devices with larger screens can use a different layout.\n\nScreen Profiles and Screen Layouts\nThe screen profiles and screen layouts are shown in Output Setup. Here \n you will see all the profiles and layouts available to the project. You \n can add and delete as required.\n\nThe profiles are mapped to the layouts within the Multiscreen HTML5 \n Single Source Layout. On first accessing the layout, all the screen profiles \n in the project will be listed on the left. They will also be listed on \n the right and be mapped to a screen layout. If you don't want an output \n for all the devices, simply highlight them on the right and use the Remove \n Screen Profile(s) button. They will be removed from both lists and the \n order will reflect whatever you set using the Move Up and Move Down buttons. \n If you add new profiles later, they will not automatically appear on the \n left, you need to use the Add Screen Profile(s) button in any layout where \n you want the new profile to be included.\n\n\nContent\nThe familiar options for defining the content for each profile are shown \n below and you need only complete those details for the profiles you retain \n above.\nBecause you can select different settings and apply different Conditional \n Build Expressions to each profile, you can have different content  for \n each device. For example, by using different User Defined Variables, you \n can use the word \"Click\" on desktop devices and \"Tap\" \n on smartphones and tablets.\n\nSearch\nThe Search settings allow you to define different search parameters \n for each profile. You may want to show a smaller number of characters \n on devices with small screens. Note that RoboHelp allows you to exclude \n specific file types from the search results.\n\nOptimization\nThe Optimization settings allow you to optimize the output for each \n device.\n\nPublish\nThe Publish settings enable you to place your output directly onto a \n server. Use these or just give your developer everything that is in your \n Generate folder.\n\nSharePoint\nIf you use SharePoint, the settings will need to be defined here. See \n SharePoint Integration \n for more information about SharePoint.\n\n \n\nGenerating\nWhen you start the generation process, you will see RoboHelp creating \n an output for each of the profiles you included. What you will find in \n the !SSL! folder is shown below. The index.htm file is not the start page \n that you are familiar with in WebHelp. In each of the output folders you \n will find the familiar structure with an index.htm file that is a start \n page for that layout.\nYour developers have four options.\nThey can \n put all the outputs on a server and point all devices to the index.htm \n page shown below. That is a \"sniffer\" and will detect what it \n needs to know about the end user's device and serve up the appropriate \n help.\n\nThey can \n put the content for a specific device on the server and link to the index.htm \n file found in the output folder for the device.For other \n devices, your developers can take the HTML5 output and convert it using \n their preferred tool.\n\n\nYou do not have to create multiple outputs. You can use this layout \n to create help just for a tablet or you can use the Desktop layout to \n create \"WebHelp\" in HTML5 format.\n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../READ_FIRST.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/READ_FIRST.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/buildtags.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/buildtags.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_01_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_01_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_01b_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_01b_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../Features/Master_Pages.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Master_Pages.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_02.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_02.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_03.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_03.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_04.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_04.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_05.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_05.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_06.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_06.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_tip.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_tip.png"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Printed_Documentation_Output.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"a1","tagName":"a","innerText":"About

Documentation Output\nNotwithstanding the trend to online information, \n many users still require printed documentation. A major change introduced \n in Adobe RoboHelp 11 was the ability to include your own headers and footers \n in the printed outputs. You can define which sections have headers and \n footers. Each section can be different and you can customize the formatting.\nIn About Employee Care it is \n explained that whilst the online help is for the US audience, printed \n documentation is required for the UK and Canadian users. This sample project \n shows how the different content is created to allow those documents to \n be produced, in addition to a printed document for the US users.\nGeneral Settings\nBy applying build tags to content, different text will be entered for \n each of the three countries. When generating any output, the build expression \n will define what text is included and what is excluded. See \n the text options in this first image and see the build expression in the \n second image.\n\nSince Adobe RoboHelp 11 you can generate multiple documents to the same \n folder provided, of course, that they have different file names. Also \n any links you have in your topics to popups will appear in your printed \n documentation, provided the target topic is in the printed document.\n\nNote how much easier it is to select the build \n expression. In older versions you would have seen the expression and had \n to work out what would get included. The name makes it obvious. \n \n\n \nHeaders and Footers\nAdding your own headers and footers can now be achieved using Master \n Pages that you set up for the purpose. You can use existing Master Pages \n but it is likely they will not quite meet your requirements.\nYou create \n a Master Page that has the headers and footers that you want. The Master \n Page Editor has some icons to add pre-configured options such as page \n numbers and chapter names. You can click Insert > Fields to add other \n field level information such as the project title and / or date. You can \n apply formatting to any part of the header and footer. See Master \n Page Enhancements.In the \n Header / Footer dropdown shown above, you can choose whichever Master \n Page you want. By default that will be applied to every page in your printed \n document.You may \n want to have different headers and footer in different sections or you \n may want to only have headers and footers in the content section, with \n nothing on the title page, the table of contents and suchlike. Click the \n Multiple Header/Footer button to access the dialog below where you can \n define your options.\n\n\nIn this project the Master Pages for use with the \n Printed Documentation Layouts have been set up with different options. \n Note how the US Master Pages include different odd and even pages so that \n the image is always on the outside when printing double sided.\n \n\nOther Topics are topics added in the Section Layout as described below.\nWord Documents refers to any Word documents that you add in the Section \n Layout.\nAdvanced Options\nThe Advanced button allows you to set a few more options.\n\nContent Settings\nWhen you first set up the content for your printed document, you will \n see the Table of Contents you selected in both panes below and the books \n will have the turquoise highlighting. In the Chapter Layout pane you can \n change the order and you can delete topics if required. When you delete \n topics, the turquoise highlighting will be removed to show that not all \n its topics will be in the printed document.\nAny changes you make later to the Table of Contents selected in the \n General Settings will be made to the pane on the left. Note however that \n the Chapter Layout will not reflect those changes. That is deliberate \n as you may not want the printed document to include everything that is \n in the Table of Contents.\n\nThe quick way to keep the two panes in sync is to click the left facing \n double chevron and then click the right facing double chevron.\nThe TOC dropdown also allows you to select topics not in the Table of \n Contents. If you add them here, they will have the same headers and footers \n as other topics in the Chapter Layout.\n\nSection Layout Settings\nThis page shows the default structure of your printed document. You \n can rearrange the order and remove sections as well as adding other Word \n documents into the layout.\nYou can also add topics to the section. You might want to do this to \n add a topic right at the end of the document about how to contact your \n organization, rather than it being part of the Chapter Layout.\nThe default title page can be deleted and you can substitute a cover \n page that  you have created in Word or Adobe RoboHelp for the purpose. \n That's especially useful if you have to apply a corporate design. See \n the Printed Documentation US Century Gothic layout which uses a different \n cover page and a different Word template.\n\nIf you do design your own cover page in Word and you are going to apply \n a Word template to the output (as described below in Appearance Settings), \n it works best if both have been created from the same Word template. If \n they are not from the same template, then do at least make sure the two \n have the same settings for Word's Normal style. Otherwise you may get \n some additional line spacing on the cover that needs to be removed.\nIn this sample project there are cover pages for both Letter Size paper \n and A4 with different fonts and each of these can be mapped to a matched \n Style Mapping template. Try creating different documents with different \n cover pages and templates. The necessary files are in the root of the \n project. They have also been copied to the Assets folder and you can import \n them into your own project if they suit your needs.\n\nAppearance Settings\nThe final page before you generate your document defines the appearance \n settings.\nThe options are to choose a Microsoft Word Template or a CSS Stylesheet. \n Neither one is better than the other, it is dependent on various factors.\nYou may \n already have a corporate Word template that you are required to use.You may \n already want the same styles as in your project but with a green theme \n rather than a blue theme. It might be easier to create that by tweaking \n your CSS.\n\nIn this example, the mapping is to a Microsoft Word template to show \n how tables and multi-level list styles can be mapped using a Microsoft \n Word template.\n\nIf you want to design your own cover pages, you need to set the paper \n size, margins and so one to the same settings as the Adobe RoboHelp Style \n Mapping templates. In the Assets folder, you will find two blank templates, \n one set to Letter Size and US English and one set to A4 and UK English.\n\nYou may want to break topics at various points in Word. Set up the customization \n below with your preferred keyboard sequence. CTRL + Q is useful as you \n can thumb CTRL and finger Q easily while you scroll through. Click anywhere \n in the paragraph you want to start on the next page and use the command. \n It also works nicely in the first paragraph in the first column of a table \n to split it at that point.\n\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_general.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_general.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_content_01.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_content_01.png"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/WebStartPage.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/WebStartPage.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_content_02_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_content_02_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_01b_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_01b_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_navigation.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_navigation.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_search.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_search.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_publish.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_publish.png"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::Title":"WebHelp Output","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/WebHelp_Output.htm::InnerText":"\n\nWebHelp Output\nWebHelp, as its name suggests, is primarily intended \n to be viewed by users accessing files stored on a web server. It can and \n often is installed on the user's desktop but for Internet Explorer you \n will need to apply what is known as the Mark of the Web (an option that \n can be applied when configuring the layout). Some users have also found \n links to Word and PDF files troublesome when WebHelp is installed locally. \n These are Windows issues, make sure you test thoroughly. For locally installed \n help the better option will be the HTML5 outputs or Microsoft HTML Help \n (CHMs).\nBelow you will find some tips on this output relating to this project \n and WebHelp generally.\nGeneral Settings\nYou can define a Favicon that will then appear in the browser tabs. \n The start page is the three frame page that shows the user the toolbar, \n the navigation pane (the table of contents and index) and the default \n topic.

This may be done by installing it on the desktop (please note the \n warning at the beginning of this topic) or by publishing it to a server,\nHow this is done depends on certain factors and how your developers \n have chosen to operate.\nWhen you generate the help, Adobe RoboHelp deletes all previous files \n in the target folder.\n\n\tIn most scenarios \n\t that is fine and all the files will be generated to that folder automatically. \n\t In that scenario, you can either zip the contents and pass the zip \n\t file to your developers or you can additionally publish direct to \n\t the server.\n\tAdvanced users \n\t may have modified the standard output in ways that require dependent \n\t files that Adobe RoboHelp is not aware of and will not be in the generated \n\t content. Publishing does not delete anything from the server so once \n\t the files have been upload uploaded, they will remain there until \n\t they are deleted manually.

However, the Company expects this support to be reciprocated by all employees so that they comply with their conditions of employment.\nThis policy is intended to alert and assist managers to reduce the incidence of absence. It is essential that managers have specific responsibility for attendance of their staff and that their staff understand that the policy will be enforced.\nRequests for all types of absence must be made to and approved by the employee's manager.\nTypes of absence\nAbsence from work occurs for a variety of reasons, but the most common are:\n\n\n\nThis table was added by copying and pasting a table from a Microsoft® Word® document. This is a feature introduced in Adobe RoboHelp 9.\nIf your source has the same styles that you want in your topic, you simply copy and paste the table.

Full details of the benefits available can be found in Company Sick Pay Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\n\nUnavailable to work\n\n\nIf an employee is unavailable for work, he/she must inform his/her manager, and give an estimated date of return to work.\nThe manager must be informed as soon as possible, and in any event not later than the commencement of Core time [10.00 am] on the day of absence.\n\n\n\n\nUnable to telephone\n\n\nIf the employee is unable to telephone to advise they will be absent, a member of the household should make the call.\nInformation must not be left with the Call Centre operator or another employee - if the employee’s manager is not available, the Human Resources Administrator must be notified and they will ensure the employee's manager is advised.\n\n\n\n\nRecording absence\n\n\nAll absence, irrespective of the reason, must be recorded on the employee’s time-sheet so that the reason[s] and duration of absence[s] are accurately reflected.\n\n\n\n\nFailure to report absence\n\n\nIf an employee fails to report to his/her manager, or cannot be located within three working days, the Company reserves the right to withhold pay for the period of the absence and to take any other relevant action.\n\n\n\n\nReturn to work\n\n\nOn return to work, managers must interview the employee to confirm the reason for the absence. If the employee has a recurring medical problem, and there is no medical advice to support frequent self-certified absences, the Company may require his/her consent to an examination by a Company nominated doctor.    \n\n\n\nProcedure for dealing with poor attendance\nThe company has control procedures to monitor unacceptable levels of absence because of their adverse impact on the Company's business objectives. In determining what constitutes an excessive level of absence and therefore whether to commence disciplinary action, the following will be taken into account:\nThe reasons for any absenceThe severity of the problemThe number of absence eventsAny apparent patternThe impact on the department and/or employee’s workloadOther circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagers must identify employees with poor attendance records and discuss these with them. Human Resources must be advised of this action.  The employee must be informed of the facts and records of unauthorized absence and warned that if there is no improvement in attendance, the Company’s Disciplinary Procedures may be initiated.\n\n \n\n\n\n","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive02_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive02_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive03_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive03_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../Features/Dynamic_Content_Filtering.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/Dynamic_Content_Filtering.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive04_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive04_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive05_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive05_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive06_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive06_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive07_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive07_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive08_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive08_2015.png"},{"origLink":"../Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive09_2015.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/responsive09_2015.png"}],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::Title":"Responsive HTML5 Output","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Outputs/Responsive_HTML5_Output.htm::InnerText":"\nResponsive HTML5 Output\nResponsive HTML5 outputs are easier to work with than Multiscreen HTML5 \n as there is only \"one\" output.\n\n\tWith Multiscreen \n\t HTML5, you specify a different screen layout for each device.

Grievances\nThe company recognizes that from time to time employees may wish to seek redress for grievances relating to their employment.\nIn this respect, the company’s policy is to encourage free communication between employees and their managers to ensure that questions and problems arising during the course of employment can be aired and, where possible, resolved quickly and to the satisfaction of all concerned.\nTo this end, the following procedure should be adopted where an employee has a grievance arising from his or her employment, except where the matter constitutes an appeal against a disciplinary decision which should be taken up in accordance with the company’s separate disciplinary appeals procedure.\nThe grievance procedure will be carried out in confidence, unless otherwise agreed with the parties involved, and will not prejudice the aggrieved employee’s current employment or future career prospects. Some grievances may be of a sensitive or controversial nature and therefore a balance must be drawn between the need to preserve this confidentiality and the need for informed discussion of the issues raised.\nIt is anticipated that most grievances will be resolved through informal discussion and the normal management channels without the need to invoke the formal grievance procedure.\nRaising a grievance informally\nAny employee who has a grievance relating to his or her employment may raise the matter informally with his or her manager during the course of normal work. This is not part of the grievance procedure. Only if the matter is not resolved between them should the formal grievance procedure need to be used.\nThe formal grievance procedure\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\n\n\nPolicy / Procedure\n\n\n\n\nStage 1 Meeting\n\n\nEmployees should put their grievances in writing to their immediate manager. However, employees should put their grievances in writing to Human Resources if they are raising a grievance against their immediate manager. The employee may at this meeting (or a stage 2 or 3 meeting), if he or she wishes, request to be accompanied by another employee/work colleague from the company or a union official or representative.\nOnce an employee has fully set out his or her grievance in writing and sent the statement or a copy of it to the employer, the employer must invite the employee to attend a meeting to discuss the grievance. All grievance meetings and appeal meetings should be held without unreasonable delay while allowing the parties to have reasonable time to prepare for those meetings. The timing and location of the grievance meeting must be reasonable.\nThe manager is required to:\nRecord full details of the matter or accept signed written details of the matterProvide an answer in writing, normally within five working days after the meeting, to the employee with a copy to the representative, if anyInform the employee in writing of his or her right to appeal and to be accompanied at the Stage 2 Meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the employee wishes to appeal, he or she must appeal in writing, normally within five working days after he or she has received the manager’s written answer. The employee’s appeal must set out the grounds of his or her appeal.\n\n\n\n\nStage 2 Meeting\n\n\nThe Stage 2 management representative will arrange to meet the employee concerned and/or, at the latter’s wish, his or her representative.\nAt this meeting the employee may be accompanied as at Stage 1. The employee’s manager may, if practicable, be present at the request of either party.\nFollowing the meeting, the management representative is required to despatch an answer, in writing, normally within five working days after the meeting to the employee and, if applicable, to the representative.\nThe written answer must also inform the employee of his or her right to appeal and to be accompanied at the Stage 3 meeting.\nIf the employee wishes to appeal, he or she must appeal in writing, normally within five working days after he or she has received the management representative’s written answer. The employee’s appeal must set out the grounds of his or her appeal.\nWhere possible, the employee’s appeal at the Stage 2 meeting must be heard by a manager (eg a more senior manager) who has not previously been involved in the case.\n\n\n\n\nStage 3 Meeting\n\n\nThe Stage 3 management representative will arrange to meet the employee concerned.\nAt this meeting the employee may be accompanied as at Stage 1. The management representative at Stages 1 and 2 may, if practicable, be present at the request of either party.\nA written answer to the grievance will be despatched to the employee normally within five working days after the meeting and, if applicable, to the representative.\nWhere possible, the employee’s appeal at the Stage 3 meeting must be heard by a manager who has not previously been involved in the case - for example, a more senior manager. The decision of the Stage 3 management representative will be final.\n\n\n\n\nTime limits\n\n\nIf the employee’s chosen companion (fellow worker or union official or representative) is not available on the day of the meeting the employee may reasonably request that the meeting be held on another day within five working days of the selected date.\nA working day is a day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a bank holiday.\nIn the absence, for any reason, of the appropriate management representative, the procedure authorizes any other executive of the company to take the necessary action on his or her behalf. At the request of the employee, however, consideration may be deferred until the return of the appropriate management representative.\nAlthough there are time limits within which answers to grievances are to be given, it is important that grievances are dealt with as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/tip.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/tip.gif"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"}],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Variables":["CoName"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Conditions":["Others:AuthorContent","Others:AuthorContent","Others:AuthorContent"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:Employee_Care_Topics"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Author":"Ann Author","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Title":"Equal Opportunities","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Equal","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Equal_Opportunities.htm::InnerText":"\n\nWhirl the World - Equal Opportunities\nThe Company is an Equal Opportunities employer.  \nThe aim of this policy is to ensure that no job applicant or employee receives less favorable treatment on the grounds of gender, race, disability, color, nationality, ethnic or national origin, marital status, sexuality, responsibility for dependants, religion or belief, trade union activity and age.  \nSelection criteria and procedures will be kept under review to ensure that individuals are selected, promoted and treated on the basis of their relevant merits and abilities.

Employees should also note that the imposition of a condition or requirement which has an adverse impact on someone, because his or her sex, race or marital status is more likely to be affected by it, will be unlawful unless it can be justified on grounds of business need. By way of example, a height requirement of 5’ 10” will eliminate some men but proportionately more women and so be unlawful. In all such situations Human Resources should be consulted.Include in all advertisements a statement on Equal Opportunities and where necessary encourage applications from under-represented groups for jobs with the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelection\n\n\nThe aim of the company is to select employees on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.\nIn order to achieve this:\nThe suitability of each applicant/candidate will be measured against the requirements for the job.The use of selection tests will be regularly examined to ensure that they are related to job requirements and are not unlawfully discriminatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromotion\n\n\nThe aim of the company is to promote employees on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.\nIn order to achieve this:\nThe promotion criteria will relate specifically to the individual’s ability and aptitude to do the job.The company will periodically review the promotion procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfer\n\n\nThe aim of the company is to (where necessary) transfer employees on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.\nIn order to achieve this:\nThe company will not automatically transfer employees who complain of discrimination.The company will periodically review its criteria for transferring employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\nAll persons responsible for recruitment, selection, promotion and transfer of staff will receive training in equal opportunities.\nTraining will achieve two objectives:\nEnable employees to recognise the company’s and their own legal obligations under legislation.Develop the necessary skills to translate the equal opportunities in employment policy into practice.\n\n\n\n\nThe company will also ensure that all its employees have equal access to training and development opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nDismissal (including redundancy) and other detriment\n\n\nThe aim of the company is to ensure that it does not unlawfully or unfairly discriminate in dismissal, redundancy or other detriment to an employee.\nIn order to achieve this the company will continually examine its procedure and criteria to ensure that they do not directly or indirectly discriminate against a particular group or groups.\n\n\n\n\nDiscipline\n\n\nAny employee who harasses any other employee on the grounds of race, sex or disability will be subject to the organization's disciplinary procedure.  In serious cases, such behavior will be deemed to constitute gross misconduct and, as such, will result in summary dismissal in the absence of mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring and positive action\n\n\nThe composition of the workforce and of job applicants will be monitored on a regular basis.

Where this occurs, the company will always consider practical help through this flexible working policy.\nNo employee will be treated less favorably, suffer detriment or be dismissed because they request, or take, flexible working.\nFlexible working is about considering the way work is organized to see whether it is possible to have different arrangements. The result must always be, however, that the company achieves its core business purpose as efficiently as is possible.\nEmployees should also be aware that if they request and are given agreed flexible working conditions this is a variation of their terms and conditions of employment and is a permanent change. If their circumstances change in relation to the need for flexible working there is no statutory right for a return to their terms and conditions as they were prior to the flexible working.\nThe company:\nWill consider requests for flexible working by those who are eligible to put in a written requestRecognizes that the initial onus of making an application is with the employeeWill follow the correct procedure as outlined hereWill reject an application where it is considered that on the grounds of business it cannot allow the flexible working as it will be detrimental to the company achieving its businessWill meet with the employee within 28 days of the application to discuss the application and will write to the employee outlining its decision within 14 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy and Procedure\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nPolicy / Procedure\n\n\n\n\nEligibility\n\n\nTo be able to request flexible working, an employee must:\nHave a child under seventeen years of age or under 18 years of age if he or she is disabledBe responsible for the child as its parent and be either a biological parent, guardian, adopter, foster-carer or be married to or be the partner of such a personHave responsibility for the upbringing of the childBe caring or expect to be caring for an adult where the flexible working request is made in relation to caring for that adultBe making the application to enable them to care for the child or adultHave worked for the company continuously for 26 weeks at the date of the application for flexible workingNot be an agency workerNot have made another application to work flexibly under the right during the past 12 months.Be able to prove that he or she meets the above criteria, in particular with regard to his or her relationship with the child or the adult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a parent\n\n\nA Parent is defined as the child’s mother, father, adopter, guardian, special guardian or foster parent; or someone who is married to, or the partner/civil partner of the child’s mother, father, adopter, guardian, special guardian or foster parent.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a carer\n\n\nThe right to request flexible working also covers employees who are caring or expect to be caring for an adult (ie a person aged 18 years or over) who is a spouse (or partner/civil partner), relative or someone else living at the same address.\n\n\n\n\nApplication\n\n\nAn application to work flexibly must be in writing and specify the following:\nThat the request is made under the terms of the flexible working legislationState whether a previous application has been made to the employer and, if so, whenSpecify the flexible working pattern applied for and the date on which it is proposed the change should come into effectExplain what effect, if any, the employee thinks the proposed change would have on the employer and how, in their opinion, any such effect might be dealt withExplain how he or she meets the eligibility criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn application must be made in writing. However, it can be submitted via letter, email or fax. Click here to see the suggested wording.\n\n\n\n\nConsideration of the request\n\n\nThe organization will give serious and full consideration to all requests to work flexibly from eligible parents.\nIf a request cannot be agreed without further discussion, a meeting will be arranged within 28 days to discuss this and consider alternative flexible options.\nThe employee is entitled to be represented at that meeting by a work colleague. If the employee or his or her representative is not available for the meeting then an alternative time suitable for all parties should be agreed upon and held within seven days.\nIf the organization cannot meet the employee’s request it will be on one or more of the following grounds:\nThe burden of additional costs.The detrimental impact on meeting customer/service demands.An inability to re-organise or re-distribute work among other existing staff.An inability to recruit additional staff (this may particularly be the case where the request leaves unusual hours to be filled by another employee).A detrimental impact on quality or performance.There is insufficient work available during the hours the employee is requesting to work.Other structural changes are planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever the outcome of the meeting, the result will be confirmed to the employee in writing within 14 days of the meeting, unless an extension is agreed.\nIf the requested change of working arrangements is accepted, the new terms and conditions that apply are permanent. The employee has no right to return to his or her old terms and the employer has no right to enforce a return unless a trial of the new terms has not proved successful.\n\n\n\n\nTrial Period\n\n\nThe organization may decide to offer the new way of working on a trial basis initially if it is not sure what the impact of it will be on the business. In such circumstances, the change to the employee’s terms and conditions of employment during the trial period is a temporary change to his or her terms and conditions of employment.\nIf the trial is not successful, the employee will revert back to his or her previous terms and conditions of employment. If the requested change of working arrangements is accepted at the end of the trial then the temporary terms and conditions will become permanent.\n\n\n\n\nAppeal\n\n\nThe employee has the right of appeal if his or her application to work flexibly is declined and must put his or her appeal in writing within 14 days of receipt of the employer’s decision, unless an extension is agreed.\nThe letter of appeal must clearly state the grounds for appeal and a further meeting will then be arranged in the same manner as the original hearing giving the employee the right to be accompanied.\nFollowing the appeal hearing, the employer will confirm the outcome in writing within a further 14 days (unless an extension has been agreed) detailing any agreement that has been met or an explanation of the grounds for dismissing the appeal.\nThe decision at the appeal hearing stage is final.\nWhere an employee appeals, another person may accompany him or her. This may be another employee of the company. An appeal may be requested and must be submitted in writing setting out the grounds, within 14 days of the decision.\n\n\n\n\nExtension of time limits\n\n\nThere is an allowance for the extension of time limits within the procedure where the manager and the employee agree. This may occur in the following two circumstances:\nFurther exploration of work patterns – at the request meeting it may be agreed by the manager and the employee that there needs to be further research into the possibilities – a record should be made of this agreement in writing, by the manager, with the extension of the time limit noted.Absence of the manager – this may apply where he or she is taking annual leave or sick leave. In either case, the time limit will be extended where the manager is absent. In this case, the manager will have 28 days to arrange the meeting from the day of his or her return to work.\n\n\n\n\nThere is no provision for any other circumstances to justify an automatic extension.\n\n\n\n\nWhen an application may be treated as withdrawn\n\n\nThe company will consider an application as being withdrawn and will no longer have a duty to consider the request when:\nAn employee gives written notification to the manager that he or she is withdrawing their application. Where the written information is not forthcoming, the manager will write seeking clarification that the employee has withdrawn their application.An employee fails to meet their responsibilities under the procedure and, therefore, it is fair in the circumstances for the manager to assume that the application is no longer being pursued. The two areas where this may occur are:Failure to attend the application meeting or the appeal meeting, more than onceUnreasonably refusing to provide the manager with information that he or she needs in order to assess whether the contract variation can be granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn employee who withdraws his or her application will not be eligible to make another flexible working request for a further twelve months\n\n\n\n\nWhere management does not respond\n\n\nWhere the employee does not get a written response within the time-frame provided within the procedure, the employee should refer to the company’s grievance procedure.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"}],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Variables":["CoName"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Conditions":["Others:UK","Others:US","Others:Canada","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK","Others:UK"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:Employee_Care_Topics"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Glossary":["SSP","SSP","SSP","SSP","SSP","SSP","SSP","SSP"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Author":"Ann Author","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Title":"Company Sick Pay","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Statutory Sick Pay,Sick Pay,Health,Attendance","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Company_Sick_Pay.htm::InnerText":"\n\nWhirl the World - Company \n Sick Pay\nIt is the Company’s policy that employees should neither suffer loss \n of basic income nor increase their income during personal illness.

At all stages of the procedure the employee will have the right to be accompanied by a union representative, or work colleague.No employee will be dismissed for a first breach of discipline except in the case of gross misconduct, when the penalty will be dismissal without notice and without payment in lieu of notice.An employee will have the right to appeal against any disciplinary action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy and Procedure\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nPolicy / Procedure\n\n\n\n\nInformal Warnings\n\nMinor breaches of discipline, misconduct, poor time-keeping and so on may result in an informal oral warning given by the employee’s immediate manager.It is expected that in most cases an informal oral warning will resolve most difficulties. Where an employee commits a more serious act of misconduct or fails to improve and maintain that improvement with regard to conduct, behavior or job performance, the formal steps detailed below may be taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Warnings\n\n\n The lists below have been created using a multi-level list style.\nA disciplinary hearing conducted by an appropriate management representative will be held. A reasonable time before the hearing the employee will be advised in writing of the reason(s) for thinking that the employee is guilty of misconduct or unsatisfactory job performance, provided with any evidence such as copies of witness statements and informed of the right to be accompanied at the hearing by a work colleague of his or her choice, or a union official. A union official means a full-time official or a lay official certified by the union as having experience of, or having been trained in, acting as a companion at disciplinary hearings. It should be noted that neither spouse/partner nor solicitor are suitable companions.At the disciplinary hearing, the employee will be invited to state his or her case and to answer the allegations against him or her. If, following the hearing, it is decided that disciplinary action should be implemented; the employee will be told of the decision and given a letter in confirmation of this as soon as practicable.In the case of minor offences the employee will be given a formal verbal warning. Employees should be advised of the reason for the warning, that it constitutes the first stage of the disciplinary procedure and of their right of appeal. This warning will be recorded and retained in the employee’s file and will remain active for disciplinary purposes for six months.In the case of a more serious offence or if a further offence occurs within the currency of a prior warning, the employee may be given a formal written warning or, where the offence is sufficiently serious, a final written warning. The written warning will state:Details of the misconduct or complaint that has occasioned the warningDetails of the action necessary to remedy the situation and any period of reviewThe period of time the warning will remain active on the employee’s file for disciplinary purposesThat the employee has the right to appeal against the warningThat any further misconduct of any kind will result in:Dismissal with appropriate notice in the case of a final written warning, orA further disciplinary hearing and a final written warning which, if unheeded, may result in dismissal with notice.Alternative disciplinary actions short of dismissal may be considered. These are:Suspension without pay up to a maximum of seven daysDemotion to a suitable job, if one is availableTransfer to another section or department or to another unit or branch of the companyLoss of seniority, pay increment or discretionary bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Dismissal\n\nEmployees may be summarily dismissed if it is established, after investigation and hearing the employee’s version of the matter, that there has been an act of gross misconduct, major breach of duty or conduct that brings or might bring the company’s name into disrepute.Gross misconduct includes (but is not limited to):Serious acts of insubordinationSerious breaches of health and safety rulesTheftFraud and deliberate falsification of recordsBeing under the influence of alcohol or drugs during working hoursSerious negligence (even a single error where the actual or potential consequences are extremely serious), which causes, or is likely to cause, unacceptable loss, damage or injuryFlagrant failure to follow the company’s documented procedures and regulationsBreach of duty regarding non-disclosure of confidential informationDeliberate or negligent damage to the company’s propertyDisorderly or indecent conductFighting or threatening physical violence on the company’s premises or at events organized or sponsored by the companyActs of incitement or actual acts of discrimination or harassment on the grounds of sex, trans-gender status, marital status, civil partnership status, pregnancy, color, race, nationality, national origins, ethnic origins, religion or belief, religious practices, sexual orientation, disability or age.Serious misuse of the employer’s computer systems, including misuse of e-mail and internet access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspension\n\nThe employee may, at the employer’s discretion, be suspended with pay while the circumstances of any complaint or allegation are investigated.In cases of potential gross misconduct, suspension with pay will be automatic.Such suspension does not constitute a disciplinary sanction but is instigated in order to allow the company to investigate the conduct in question properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeal\n\nThe employee may appeal in writing to Human Resources against any disciplinary action within seven days of receipt of the letter confirming the action taken.An appeal hearing will be held.The employee will have the right to be accompanied at the appeal hearing by a work colleague of his/her choice or a union official. A union official means a full-time official or a lay official certified by the union as having experience of, or having been trained in, acting as a companion at disciplinary hearings. It should be noted that neither spouse/partner nor solicitor are suitable companionsFollowing the hearing, the appeal decision will be confirmed in writing.The decision at the end of the appeal is final.The decision may include:The original decision is upheldThe original decision is overturnedSuspension without payDemotionRe-instatement where the employee has been dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/empcare.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"},{"origLink":"../../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"}],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Variables":["CoName"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:Employee_Care_Topics"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Author":"Ann Author","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Title":"Health and Safety","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Health","Path::contents/Employee_Care/HR_Policies/Health_and_Safety.htm::InnerText":"\n\nWhirl the World - Health and Safety\nThe Company is keen that our offices and work practices do not cause harm to the environment. In addition to meeting legal health, safety and environmental policies we have adopted a number of measures to ensure that we contribute to a sustainable and healthy environment. These measures include but are not limited to:\nRecycling waste paper.Recycling other office waste such as toner cartridges.Using re-usable plates, cups and suchlike instead of disposable items where practical.Donating surplus promotion items such as pads and pens to local charities or schools.Use of energy saving facilities on machines such as copiers and printers.Where possible trying to provide information electronically or though our website to save production of unnecessary waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\nThe Company policy is to provide and maintain safe and healthy working conditions, equipment and systems of work for all employees, and to provide such information, training and supervision as they need for this purpose.

the World - Attendance\nThe company wishes to support staff who are unable to fulfil the terms of their employment contract regarding attendance at work for reasons beyond their control. However, the Company expects this support to be reciprocated by all employees so that they comply with their conditions of employment.\nThis policy is intended to alert and assist managers to reduce the incidence of absence. It is essential that managers have specific responsibility for attendance of their staff and that their staff understand that the policy will be enforced.\nRequests for all types of absence must be made to and approved by the employee's manager.\nTypes of absence\nAbsence from work occurs for a variety of reasons, but the most common are:\nCompany Policy\nHolidays\nStudy Leave\nMaternity Leave\nAbsence by employee\nSickness\nAccident\nMedical Consultation\nStatutory\nJury Service\nUnauthorized Absence\nLateness of over two hours\nNon-conformance with the Policy\n \nThe scale of entitlements is sufficient to allow for most discretionary requirements.  However, a manager has discretion to allow up to two days paid or unpaid additional leave per year appropriate for the circumstances.\nProcedure for Unauthorized Absence\nThis procedure is concerned with unauthorized absences that have NOT been approved by an employee’s manager.\nTo be eligible for sick pay, an employee must comply with the procedures for the notification and certification of absence set out below.\nUnavailable to work\nIf an employee is unavailable for work, he/she must inform his/her manager, and give an estimated date of return to work.\nThe manager must be informed as soon as possible, and in any event not later than the commencement of Core time [10.00 am] on the day of absence.\nUnable to telephone\nIf the employee is unable to telephone to advise they will be absent, a member of the household should make the call.\nInformation must not be left with the Call Centre operator or another employee - if the employee’s manager is not available, the Human Resources Administrator must be notified and they will ensure the employee's manager is advised.\nRecording absence\nAll absence, irrespective of the reason, must be recorded on the employee’s time-sheet so that the reason[s] and duration of absence[s] are accurately reflected.\nFailure to report absence\nIf an employee fails to report to his/her manager, or cannot be located within three working days, the Company reserves the right to withhold pay for the period of the absence and to take any other relevant action.\nReturn to work\nOn return to work, managers must interview the employee to confirm the reason for the absence. If the employee has a recurring medical problem, and there is no medical advice to support frequent self-certified absences, the Company may require his/her consent to an examination by a Company nominated doctor.\nProcedure for dealing with poor attendance\nThe company has control procedures to monitor unacceptable levels of absence because of their adverse impact on the Company's business objectives. In determining what constitutes an excessive level of absence and therefore whether to commence disciplinary action, the following will be taken into account:\n- The reasons for any absence\n- The severity of the problem\n- The number of absence events\n- Any apparent pattern\n- The impact on the department and/or employee’s workload\n- Other circumstances.\nManagers must identify employees with poor attendance records and discuss these with them. Human Resources must be advised of this action.  The employee must be informed of the facts and records of unauthorized absence and warned that if there is no improvement in attendance, the Company’s Disciplinary Procedures may be initiated.\n\n \n\n\n\n","Path::index/EMPLOYEE_CARE.idx::Links":[],"Path::index/EMPLOYEE_CARE.idx::Variables":[],"Path::index/EMPLOYEE_CARE.idx::Conditions":["Others:UK"],"Path::index/EMPLOYEE_CARE.idx::TopicConditions":[],"Path::index/EMPLOYEE_CARE.idx::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::index/EMPLOYEE_CARE.idx::Glossary":[],"Path::index/EMPLOYEE_CARE.idx::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/EmployeeCareStd.htt"},{"origLink":"../assets/css/empcare-epub.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/empcare-epub.css"},{"origLink":"../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"},{"origLink":"../assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts","attr":"data-conref","topic":"contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm","nodeName":"div","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/snippets/HR Contact.hts"}],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Variables":["CoName"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::TopicConditions":["Others:eBookOnly","Others:Employee_Care_Topics"],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Author":"Ann Author","Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Title":"Health and Safety","Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::Status":"Complete","Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Safety,Health","Path::contents/Employee_Care_eBook/Health_and_Safety_eBook.htm::InnerText":"\n\nWhirl the World - Health and Safety\nThe Company is keen that our offices and work practices do not cause harm to the environment. In addition to meeting legal health, safety and environmental policies we have adopted a number of measures to ensure that we contribute to a sustainable and healthy environment. These measures include but are not limited to:\n- Recycling waste paper.\n- Recycling other office waste such as toner cartridges.\n- Using re-usable plates, cups and suchlike instead of disposable items where practical.\n- Donating surplus promotion items such as pads and pens to local charities or schools.\n- Use of energy saving facilities on machines such as copiers and printers.\n- Where possible trying to provide information electronically or though our website to save production of unnecessary waste.\nPolicy\n- The Company policy is to provide and maintain safe and healthy working conditions, equipment and systems of work for all employees, and to provide such information, training and supervision as they need for this purpose.
