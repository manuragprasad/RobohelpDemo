Linking and Importing Word and FrameMaker Docs
Linking provides a "synchronization" 
 workflow between Subject Matter Experts (SME) who retain authorship of 
 the FrameMaker or Word document and authors who need that content in their 
 project.
Importing allows content to be created from existing documents but with 
 no ongoing link. The workflow is otherwise very similar.
Link or Import?
Many authors choose to Import content from Microsoft Word or Adobe FrameMaker 
 into their RoboHelp projects. This is perfect for workflows where the 
 original document is no longer necessary and importing is a one-time action.
However, there are scenarios where SMEs retain "ownership" 
 of the original document and because it changes frequently, it would help 
 the RoboHelp author to "Link" rather than Import the document.

	If you are using 
	 the Adobe Technical Communication Suite, you can Link 
	 FrameMaker documents to your RoboHelp projects as described below 
	 under Linking.
	If you have 
	 RoboHelp as a standalone application you still have the Import 
	 workflow available. With that, you can take advantage of the same 
	 style mapping and topic-splitting features as the FrameMaker file 
	 is imported and converted. Read 
	 more below in this topic.

Linking
The "live linking" process is the same for both Microsoft 
 Word or Adobe FrameMaker documents. Below, you can see both Word and FrameMaker 
 documents have been linked to the project. The originals may be on a network 
 share, SharePoint, or other location that can be shared between SME and 
 author.

The green icon in the first screenshot shows the two documents are up 
 to date. The next image shows a yellow "caution" icon which 
 tells the RoboHelp author that the SME has made a change and the project 
 needs to be updated to remain "in sync".
Try it yourself, with the linked Microsoft Word document in this project

	Right-click 
	 the New Employee Checklist.docx file in the Project Manager pod and 
	 choose Edit.
	RoboHelp will 
	 open the document in Word.
	Make some changes 
	 to the document, then close and save.
	Once Microsoft 
	 Word closes you should notice the icon representing this document 
	 changes to yellow.
	Then right-click 
	 the icon and choose Update. This will cause the associated topics 
	 in RoboHelp to update with the latest content.

To 
 map the Microsoft Word or Adobe FrameMaker files to Adobe RoboHelp
In brief, on the Project ribbon click Settings in the Link group and 
 then click Edit for Word or FrameMaker.

	Here you see 
	 how the Word Style for Heading 1 is being mapped to the RoboHelp CSS 
	 style sheet Heading 1.
	As many styles 
	 as you like can be mapped in this way, saving a lot of repetitive 
	 time.
	The Pagination 
	 checkbox means that the author can split a long Word document into 
	 separate topic files "in one go" - all based on styles.
