New Responsive HTML5 Layouts
Two new Responsive HTML5 screen layouts have been added with the new 
 filter icon that enables end users to access the Dynamic Content Filtering.
See the Responsive 
 HTML5 Output topic that describes how to generate outputs using these 
 screen layouts.
RoboHelp (2015 release) ships with a brand new layout that greatly enhances 
 the end-user experience. In the new layout you can:

	Configure the search results to 
	 appear in the content or topic panes
	Use the Comments field in the Status 
	 tab of Topic Properties for Descriptions that appear in the search 
	 instead of the first few lines of the topic.
	Show breadcrumbs and search context 
	 in the search results.
	Easily show/hide widgets such as 
	 index/glossary/TOC and so on.
	Add social widgets out of the box 
	 so that pages can be shared on Facebook or Twitter.
	Choose to hide the branding bar 
	 on smartphones to give more screen space.
	Convert to right to left layout 
	 with the click of a button. Note that you cannot create topics using 
	 right to left languages in RoboHelp. The content can be created by 
	 translation agencies or Technical Communication Suite users can link 
	 to FrameMaker content.

The new layout remembers the state of the books in the TOC and two or 
 more books can be expanded.
