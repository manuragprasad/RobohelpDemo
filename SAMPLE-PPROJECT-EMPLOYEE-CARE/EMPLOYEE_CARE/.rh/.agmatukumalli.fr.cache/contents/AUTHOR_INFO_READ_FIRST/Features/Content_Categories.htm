Content Categories
Dynamic Content Filtering 
 is an HTML5 feature for responsive layouts as it relies on code not available 
 in WebHelp. Instead for WebHelp you can use Content Categories (sometimes 
 referred to as Dynamic User-Centric Content) to provide end-users with 
 various options in a dropdown. The content is then filtered according 
 to their choice.
The author can customize the content according to user roles, product 
 types, geographical areas or whatever is preferred.
In this sample project the WebHelp Content Categories output is set 
 up to show how this works. Generate that output and you can see the differences 
 described below.
