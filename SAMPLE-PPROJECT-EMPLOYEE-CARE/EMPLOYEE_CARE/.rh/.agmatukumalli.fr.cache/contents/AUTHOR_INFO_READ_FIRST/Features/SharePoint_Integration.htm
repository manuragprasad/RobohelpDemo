SharePoint Integration
Your RoboHelp project can be integrated with Sharepoint to provide source control and you can publish your outputs to SharePoint. Also it can be used for sharing topics and other resources with your co-authors.
Source Control
SharePoint is a growing platform for teams of multiple authors who need to keep their content synchronized. Version and source control with the integrated RoboHelp and SharePoint workflow allows project team members to check files in or out and maintain history records all from a convenient toolbar right within RoboHelp.
