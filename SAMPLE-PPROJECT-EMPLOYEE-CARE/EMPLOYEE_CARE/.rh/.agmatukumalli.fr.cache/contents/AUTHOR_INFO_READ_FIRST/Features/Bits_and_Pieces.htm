Bits and Pieces
There's always something that doesn't warrant a full topic or fit neatly 
 somewhere else! Here are some of those.
Expanding and Dropdown Hotspots with Dynamic HTML (DHTML)
The idea of "progressive disclosure" is something authors 
 are using in order to layer content especially with smaller screens on 
 mobile devices. In this way, the end-user self-selects the information 
 they are interested in. You can access DHTML on the Insert ribbon.
Topic Titles can have User Defined Variables assigned
Control and customize content better by applying a User Defined Variable 
 to a wider range of content, including the Topic Title and Table of Contents. 
 Automate updates by simply making a single change to the UDV value in 
 the UDV pod. To see this in action, go to the About 
 Employee Care 3 topic, right click on the topic and choose "Topic 
 Properties." You will see that the Knowledge Base Name User Defined 
 Variable has been inserted in to the Topic Title.

 
The UDV Properties tell you where the each UDV has been used...

 
... and that can include the Table of Contents.

Clear Formatting and Reset Style
One constant frustration for authors is importing content from documents 
 written without proper styling. When imported into RoboHelp, "inline styles" or "overides" 
 can defeat your hard work in designing a proper CSS. Clear Formatting 
 and Reset Style are commands that let your CSS control the styling without 
 inline styles getting in the way.

	Make a selection 
	 and click Format > Clear formatting. All styling is cleared.
	Reset Style 
	 is done from the Styles and Formatting pod. In this scenario, resetting 
	 a style resets both CSS and inline styles from a single HTML element 
	 by removing style related attributes like "class" and "style" 
	 from selected HTML element tag. Other CSS code remains.

Enhanced CSS3 management
Create CSS styles either using a built-in visual style editor or choose 
 a new HTML code editor for those who like to edit directly. View and modify 
 attributes, edit the <img> tags, and format 
 hyperlinks, text boxes, and block elements.
Close All But This
When the help author has elected to use the Allow Editing of Multiple 
 Topics function, they are also able to right-click any tab in the editor 
 and choose to close all other open tabs.
Remember Project State
From RoboHelp (2015 release) whichever topics you have open in the Design 
 Editor when you close it will reopen when you return.
Note: Which topics were open is held in the CPD 
 file so if you delete the CPD, RoboHelp will not reopen the topics.
