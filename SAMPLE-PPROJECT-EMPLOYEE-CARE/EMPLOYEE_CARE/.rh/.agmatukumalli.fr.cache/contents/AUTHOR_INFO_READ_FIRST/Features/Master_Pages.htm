Master Pages
Creating Headers and Footers
You can create headers and footers in single topics or include them 
 in Master Pages and apply them to many topics at once. Master Pages can 
 be created for both online help and to provide headers and footers for 
 your Printed Documentation. Whilst you can use a single Master Page for 
 both purposes, it is more likely you will want to use specific pages for 
 each.
Master Pages for online help
The Master Page can also include body content that will default into 
 new topics when created.
 It is a cause of common 
 confusion to think that a change to the content in the Body Placeholder 
 will update previously created topics, it will only affect subsequently 
 created topics. It is only changes to the header and footer in the Master 
 Page that will affect existing topics.
Master Pages for printed documentation
Any text in the Body PlaceHolder section will be ignored when using 
 the Master Page for Printed Documentation.
An example of a Master page appears below showing the United States 
 Even Pages version of the Headers and Footers for Printed Documentation 
 as seen in the Design Editor.


Note you can include many resources in Headers/Footers including tables, 
 links, graphics and variables but not snippets. A new shortcut toolbar 
 makes it easy to add items to the Master Page.
How to use Master Pages with your printed documentation is described 
 in the Printed Documentation 
 topic.
Creating Master Pages
First go to the Output Setup pod, right-click Master Pages > New 
 Master Page. (The Output Setup pod was called the Project Setup pod in 
 earlier versions of RoboHelp.)


Then use the shortcuts in the toolbar above the Master Page. You can also 
 use Insert > Fields to insert various options such as the Date or Project 
 Title.
