About Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release)
The Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) features are summarized in this sample 
 project.
The Adobe RoboHelp 
 (2015 release) main product page on Adobe's site and the Starter page 
 when you open Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) will take you to the following 
 important resources:


 

	
	
	
		Feature
		Description
	
	
		Enable end-users to quickly 
		 find relevant content
		
	
	
		Dynamic 
		 Content Filtering
		 
		Responsive layouts allow your content 
		 to be viewed with ease on desktops, tablets and smartphones. The 
		 appearance adapts to suit the device, RoboHelp takes care of that. 
		 Now RoboHelp (2015 release) adds something extra for your end-users, 
		 dynamic content filtering.
		
			You provide the filter options to 
			 suit the requirement be that geographical regions, trade specialization, 
			 equipment type and so on.
			The end-user chooses what they want 
			 to see rather than having to wade through everything you have 
			 provided.
		
		Whatever options the end-user chooses, the 
		 results come from one output. Authors who have used Content Categories 
		 with its output for each category will welcome this reduced footprint.
		Authors can quickly see how the options will 
		 work by using the Tagged Output View.
		You can set this up so that the user can select 
		 just one of the options or so that they can multi-pick. If you 
		 have used Content Categories (Dynamic User-Centric Content) in 
		 an earlier version of RoboHelp you will welcome the greater options 
		 Dynamic Content Filtering brings, so will your end-users.
		Dynamic Content Filtering comes with URL support 
		 which means that you can embed the filters within a URL and then 
		 use that URL in CSH calls giving more targeted contextual help.
		How this is all done  is described in 
		 Dynamic Content 
		 Filtering.
	
	
		Make your content mobile 
		 ready with the best-in-class publishing
		
	
	
		New HTML5 layout
		RoboHelp (2015 release) ships with brand 
		 new layouts that greatly enhance the end-user experience. In the 
		 new layout you can:
		
			Configure the search results to appear 
			 in the content or topic panes
			Use the Comments field in the Status 
			 tab of Topic Properties for Descriptions that appear in the 
			 search instead of the first few lines of the topic.
			Show breadcrumbs and search context 
			 in the search results.
			Easily show/hide widgets such as index/glossary/TOC 
			 and so on.
			Add social widgets out of the box 
			 so that pages can be shared on Facebook or Twitter.
			Choose to hide the branding bar on 
			 smartphones to give more screen space.
			Convert to right to left layout with 
			 the click of a button. Note that you cannot create topics 
			 using right to left languages in RoboHelp. The content can 
			 be created by translation agencies or Technical Communication 
			 Suite users can link to FrameMaker content.
		
		The new layout remembers the state of the 
		 books in the TOC and two or more books can be expanded.
	
	
		Embed custom fonts in ePub
		In RoboHelp (2015 release) you can embed 
		 a custom font in the ePub output, which ensures that users see 
		 high quality typography irrespective of whether they have the 
		 font on their systems or not.
		You need to have the distribution rights for 
		 the embedded fonts.
	
	
		Faster and better HTML5 output
		The Responsive HTML5 outputs are faster 
		 and better than ever before. The HTML5 code for the desktop view 
		 was made cleaner in RoboHelp 11 to enable the pages to load faster 
		 with a 50% reduction in loading time and take less space with 
		 savings of ~20KB per topic. This improvement has now been extended 
		 to work with all devices.
	
	
		Create apps for iOS, Android 
		 and Windows platforms
		
	
	
		Mobile app output support
		Mobile app generation is greatly simplified 
		 in RoboHelp (2015 release) . You can generate mobile apps for 
		 your content for iOS and Android platforms in a seamless one click 
		 generation process. The workflow uses an integration with PhoneGap.
		If you need to generate multiple apps, you 
		 will need to purchase a Phonegap license separately.
	
	
		A new ribbon based user 
		 interface and productivity enhancements
		
	
	
		Ribbon based UI
		Now work in a modern Ribbon Based interface 
		 where all menu items are logically grouped in various tabs according 
		 to common workflows allowing easy accessibility and more productivity. 
		 Some tabs are context sensitive; the Table tab for example only 
		 appears when you are editing a table.
		Customize the interface by choosing one of 
		 four themes and select either colored or greyscale icons. Boost 
		 your productivity with the customizable quick access toolbar, 
		 contextual tabs, and much more.
		If your screen size is limited in depth you 
		 can set the ribbon to auto-hide when not needed.
	
	
		Enhanced find and replace
		Now work much faster with the revamped 
		 Find & Replace 
		 functionality. You now use the same pod whether you want to look 
		 in a single topic or search through all your topics. You can search 
		 in backward or forward direction and set the search scope to "current 
		 project", "current window", "specific folder", 
		 or all opened files.
		Multi line search is also supported and you 
		 can search in the TOC and Index pods. You can zip through search 
		 results to easily edit the topic by double clicking any line.
	
	
		Named condition build expressions
		If you work with complex build expressions 
		 you will know how difficult it can be to remember the purpose 
		 of each one. Now you can name the expressions making choosing 
		 the right one so much simpler. It eliminates the hassle of remembering 
		 and deciphering the logic every time you want to use an expression.
		You can see this in the Dynamic 
		 Content Filtering topic.
	
	
		Enhanced conditional tag indicators
		With enhanced conditional tags indicators 
		 in Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) , the readability of the content 
		 is not compromised even if multiple tags are applied on any given 
		 content. Furthermore, it is easy to figure out which tags are 
		 applied and where conditions change within a topic. Cross hatching 
		 broke legibility, overlining means you can still read the content.
		
	
	
		Remember project state
		In Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) you no 
		 longer need to remember which topics and pods were opened the 
		 last time when you closed a project as the project state is automatically 
		 remembered Each time you a open a project, it opens in exactly 
		 the state in which it was closed.
		Note: Which topics were open is held in 
		 the CPD file so if you delete the CPD, RoboHelp will not reopen 
		 the topics.
	
	
		Adobe Captivate support
		Easily integrate HTML5 and SWF content 
		 created with Adobe Captivate. Enhance your help content with show-me 
		 demos, how-to movies, and interactive quizzes.
	
	
		Locate in Project Manager
		Need to locate a specific topic in the 
		 Project Manager? No problem, with just a single click on the topic, 
		 or in the TOC and topic list pod, you can locate and highlight 
		 the topic in the Project Manager.
		Click Locate Item in the View group on the 
		 Project tab or right click in a topic and select from the context 
		 menu.
	
	
		Easily update styles
		You can easily edit the style in a CSS 
		 by first applying inline styling and then click Update Style so 
		 that the CSS is updated.
