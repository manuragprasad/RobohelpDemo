Whirl the World - Dependants 
 Leave
This policy details the Company's responsibilities toward its employees 
 and the arrangements relating to an employee in respect of unpaid time 
 off to care for dependants.
Scope
Dependants are defined as an employee’s husband, wife, parent, child, 
 or any other family member who lives in the employee’s home but not tenants, 
 lodgers or people employed by the employee. Partners and elderly relatives 
 living with the family are included.
Policy and Procedure
 
 In this topic instead of showing the various items in a table as in other 
 topics, the content has been placed in the dropdowns below so that you 
 can see an alternative way of presenting information. In a real project 
 you would more likely use one method as a consistent approach makes it 
 easier for your users.
You should consider this when creating content on devices with small screens. 
 Whilst tables make it easy for the reader to locate an item, they may 
 take up valuable space needed by another column with more text to display.
Entitlement

	Employees are entitled to take a reasonable amount of time off during 
	 working hours when it is necessary:
	
		To provide care when a dependant falls ill, gives birth 
		 or is injured
		To make arrangements to provide care for a dependant who 
		 is ill or injured
		When a dependant dies
		To deal with unexpected disruption or termination of arrangements 
		 for the care of a dependant
		To deal with an unexpected incident involving the child 
		 of the employee when the child’s school has responsibility for 
		 him/her.
	
	This entitlement does not apply to domestic emergencies such as 
	 a water leak. There is no minimum period of employment with the company 
	 to qualify for time off to care for dependants.
Procedure

	Time off to care for dependants is unpaid, including pension contributions.
	The amount of time off must be reasonable for the circumstances, 
	 with an expectation of one or two days in most cases.
	The employee must notify his/her manager of the reason for requiring 
	 time off, and its expected duration, as soon as practical, in advance 
	 if possible.  Employees must complete the Dependants Care form 
	 and pass it to Human Resources or the local administrator after his/her 
	 manager has signed it.

	 Care application form.
Disputes

	The company expects that differences about refusing a request for 
	 leave or an unreasonable postponement can be resolved by discussion 
	 with their Manager and Human Resources. The Company does have a formal 
	 Grievance Procedure.
