Informal Warnings

Minor breaches of discipline, misconduct, poor time-keeping and so on may result in an informal oral warning given by the employee’s immediate manager.It is expected that in most cases an informal oral warning will resolve most difficulties. Where an employee commits a more serious act of misconduct or fails to improve and maintain that improvement with regard to conduct, behavior or job performance, the formal steps detailed below may be taken.







Formal Warnings


 The lists below have been created using a multi-level list style.
A disciplinary hearing conducted by an appropriate management representative will be held. A reasonable time before the hearing the employee will be advised in writing of the reason(s) for thinking that the employee is guilty of misconduct or unsatisfactory job performance, provided with any evidence such as copies of witness statements and informed of the right to be accompanied at the hearing by a work colleague of his or her choice, or a union official. A union official means a full-time official or a lay official certified by the union as having experience of, or having been trained in, acting as a companion at disciplinary hearings. It should be noted that neither spouse/partner nor solicitor are suitable companions.At the disciplinary hearing, the employee will be invited to state his or her case and to answer the allegations against him or her. If, following the hearing, it is decided that disciplinary action should be implemented; the employee will be told of the decision and given a letter in confirmation of this as soon as practicable.In the case of minor offences the employee will be given a formal verbal warning. Employees should be advised of the reason for the warning, that it constitutes the first stage of the disciplinary procedure and of their right of appeal. This warning will be recorded and retained in the employee’s file and will remain active for disciplinary purposes for six months.In the case of a more serious offence or if a further offence occurs within the currency of a prior warning, the employee may be given a formal written warning or, where the offence is sufficiently serious, a final written warning. The written warning will state:Details of the misconduct or complaint that has occasioned the warningDetails of the action necessary to remedy the situation and any period of reviewThe period of time the warning will remain active on the employee’s file for disciplinary purposesThat the employee has the right to appeal against the warningThat any further misconduct of any kind will result in:Dismissal with appropriate notice in the case of a final written warning, orA further disciplinary hearing and a final written warning which, if unheeded, may result in dismissal with notice.Alternative disciplinary actions short of dismissal may be considered.
